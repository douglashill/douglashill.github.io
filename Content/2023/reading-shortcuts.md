An update to my [reading app](https://douglashill.co/reading-app/) is out that adds Shortcuts actions to automate and integrate with other apps. You can filter/sort based on many properties, including word count. There are also new lists for “Short Articles” and “Long Articles”.

Sort by: Word Count. Order: Biggest First. Limit: Off. Choose from Articles. Open Chosen Item. Right side of screen shows all available actions for the Reading app: Add Articles, Delete Articles, Find Articles, Get Body of Article, and Open Article.">
