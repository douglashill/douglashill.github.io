If an Apple Bluetooth Magic Mouse/Trackpad/Keyboard normally paired to an iPad is paired to a device you no longer have access to, you can pair it back to the iPad like this:

1. Plug the peripheral into a Mac
2. Forget the peripheral from the Mac
3. The peripheral will now be discoverable for the iPad
