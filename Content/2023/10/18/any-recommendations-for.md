Any recommendations for a *plain text* notes/scratchpad app with CloudKit sync? Importance: iPad > Mac > iPhone

Bear 1 hit the sweet spot. The [Bear 2](https://bear.app/) editor is too non-standard. [Tot](https://tot.rocks) adds angle brackets around pasted links. [FSNotes](https://fsnot.es/) has good UI but iCloud Drive sync works poorly for this.
