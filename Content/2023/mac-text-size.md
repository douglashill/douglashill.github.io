Fantastic to see the [Text Size setting on Mac](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/05/apple-previews-live-speech-personal-voice-and-more-new-accessibility-features/). Hope at WWDC we see this extended automatically to Catalyst and iOS apps on Mac (this feature has been on iOS for 9 years). SwiftUI/AppKit API support would be extra cool.
