We hit the 10,000 limit on TestFlight testers for [PDF Viewer](https://pdfviewer.io/) a while ago. Using the new filtering options, I removed the 10% of these that had never installed a build, so it’s now possible to [sign up](https://pdfviewer.io/faq/ios-how-do-i-join-the-ios-testflight-beta/) again.

Tip: Filtering within groups was unreliable. Filtering from “All Testers” worked better.
