Great team effort wrapping up the year at PSPDFKit with [one last release](https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2023/pspdfkit-13-2-ios-advanced-digital-signatures/). We overhauled how we digitally signing documents, ending up with an API that’s simpler and more flexible.

We’ve also been iterating on our [public preview for visionOS](https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2023/pspdfkit-for-visionos-public-preview/) that we announced in September.
