It’s really tempting seeing the [try! Swift Tokyo](https://tryswift.jp/_en) conference announced for 2024. I had an amazing time there in 2019 and stayed in Japan to ski, hike and live in a little village by the sea. But I think I’ll stick with my no flying streak (since Jan 2020) and will ski in Austria instead.
