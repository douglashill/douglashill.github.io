Spent a bit of time updating my [reading app](https://douglashill.co/reading-app/)’s lists to use more standard UI. Cut the code down by 300 lines. Had in mind to rewrite lists in SwiftUI to dramatically trim the code so I could focus more on the core reading experience, but so many details weren’t right in my POC.
