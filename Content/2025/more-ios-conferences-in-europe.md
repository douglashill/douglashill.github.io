Here’s another roundup of Swift/iOS conferences in Europe later this year:

- 18–19 September: [NSSpain](https://2025.nsspain.com/) in Logroño A very fun and sociable conference. [Talk submissions](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeR9Lg_1gH-ONusOKIQRKQzXy8JKi1mYdiLIpfFkC8OAEN3Xw/viewform) just opened yesterday until the end of the month.
- 2–3 October: [Server-Side.swift](https://www.serversideswift.info/) in London. This is a lot about the language itself so is relevant to iOS developers. We’ll have an [NSLondon](https://nslondon.com/) pub evening nearby on the evening between the conference days. [Talk submissions](https://www.papercall.io/serversideswift-2025) are open until the end of the month.
- 6–7 October: [Swift Connection](https://swiftconnection.io/) in Paris. This was great last year but unfortunately clashes with SwiftLeeds this year, so I won’t make it. [Talk submissions](https://sessionize.com/swift-connection-2025/) close in two days!
- 7–8 October: [SwiftLeeds](https://swiftleeds.co.uk/) in Leeds. Talk submissions already closed. I’m planning to be there.
- 30–31 October: [#Pragma](https://www.pragmaconference.com/) in Bologna. [Talk submissions](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdfqCRaIFLSFthBoaii92pStWueUFy-yHlgVySapLaew6h3Yg/viewform) are open until the end of July. I’m planning to be there.
- 12–13 November: [Do iOS](https://do-ios.com/) in Amsterdam. [Talk submissions](https://www.papercall.io/do-ios-2025) are open until the end of July. Thanks to [Rick van Voorden for letting me know](https://bsky.app/profile/vanvoorden.bsky.social/post/3ls2lt6qp522k) about this.

Let me know if I missed one.
