Is there any way to hack Xcode to skip the “The file “whatever.xcodeproj” has been modified by another application” alerts? Xcode writes project changes to disk immediately, so obviously after changing branch I always want the version on disk.

Do you want to keep the Xcode version, or use the version on disk? Use Version on Disk; Keep Xcode Version.](screenshot.png)
