Iâ€™m late posting this, but Swift Connection has published the [recording of my talk on zoom transitions](https://async.techconnection.io/talks/swift-connection/swift-connection-2024/douglas-hill-zoom-transitions-a-comprehensive-guide) in Paris last September. I also put up a [page linking to the relevant resources](/zoom-transitions-talk/).
