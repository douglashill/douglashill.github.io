After [complaining earlier this month about Xcode’s handling of branch changes](/2025/use-version-on-disk/), I found an [older post/tweet about nearly the same thing from 9 years ago](/status/793360904368697344/), although I don’t know what that was replying to. So many old tweets are gone. Times change, but not so much Xcode.
