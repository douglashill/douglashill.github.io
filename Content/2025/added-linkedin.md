[Added LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/douglashill-co) as an experimental additional way to follow my posts. I’ve heard that while the social media landscape has been tumultuous, LinkedIn has been a rock. Everything will be cross-posted from my website, same as how Bluesky [etc.](https://douglashill.co/follow/) are set up. No filtering for only ‘professional’ posts.
