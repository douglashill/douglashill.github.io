Really cool to see our larger NSLondon organising team allowing us to try different kinds of events for the iOS developer community. This Sunday weâ€™re doing a [walk between the Battersea and Regent Steet Apple stores](https://www.meetup.com/nslondon/events/306186989/), passing Buckingham Palace. (Too bad I canâ€™t join because Iâ€™m in the Alps. ðŸ˜„)
