![Screenshot of end of Mac menu bar. Popup from camera icon says “Turn On Reactions: Zoom has turned off Reaction effects. Click camera icon and select Reactions to add more impact to your gestures.”](screenshot.jpg)

At first, I thought it was a Zoom programming error that this popup appears every time I start a video call on my Mac, but it looks like this is a [system feature](https://support.apple.com/en-us/105117) that boring Zoom users like me should be constantly nagged about. Clicking the × doesn’t do anything.
