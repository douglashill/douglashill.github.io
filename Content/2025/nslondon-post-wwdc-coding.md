We’re trying an old idea again at NSLondon. If you’ve watched some WWDC sessions now, come and put it into practice [coding together at a cafe on Sunday 29 June](https://www.meetup.com/nslondon/events/308498990/). Location TDB. Tell me if you know a great cafe we should meet at! I’m planning to use the time to test and update [KeyboardKit](https://github.com/douglashill/KeyboardKit) for iOS 26.
