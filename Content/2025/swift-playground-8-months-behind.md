The update to Swift Playground last week added the [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/swift-playground/id908519492) 18 and [macOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/swift-playground/id1496833156) 15 SDKs. It’s 4.5 months after these SDKs shipped in stable Xcode and nearly 8 months after the first Xcode 16 beta. Given this app is the only option for making iOS apps on iPad, Xcode for iPad can’t come soon enough.
