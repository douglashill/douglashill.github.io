Is there a best practice for implementing `description` and `debugDescription` for main actor classes with Swift strict concurrency? This works, but seems off:

```
override var description: String {
    if Thread.isMainThread {
        MainActor.assumeIsolated {
            "\(type(of: self)) Property 1: \(property1), Property 2: \(property2)"
        }
    } else {
        "\(type(of: self))(Not on main thread)"
    }
}
```
