Update on Apple’s “Turn On Reactions” nag: Turning off *Notifications* for *FaceTime* then restarting my Mac made these popups stop when using Zoom. This makes little sense given these aren’t notifications, and I’ve never used FaceTime on a Mac. Found in [this Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/171rs4k/comment/m5x0odz/) [thanks to Caesar Wirth](https://mas.to/users/cjwirth/statuses/114080988448046559).
