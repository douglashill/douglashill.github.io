We released Nutrient iOS SDK 14.12 (formerly PSPDFKit). The [release notes](https://www.nutrient.io/guides/ios/releases/14-12/) aren’t really about this release, but instead about what’s happening next month. Apple’s big UI update needs navigating carefully, as using the wrong version of Xcode will lead to trouble.
