My [reading app](/reading-app/) will become unavailable [on Apple’s app store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1341378303) in five days, because I’m letting my paid Apple Developer membership expire. As I understand things, if you “Get” the app now, you’ll still be able to download it after that point.
