Here’s a quick roundup of upcoming iOS conferences in Europe.

In the next month or so:

- [iOSKonf](https://www.ioskonf.mk/) in Skopje. Looks like a cracking speaker lineup.
- [Swift Craft](https://swiftcraft.uk/) in Folkestone. I’ll be there!
- [mDevCamp](https://mdevcamp.eu/) in Prague. Luckily in the week before WWDC.

In the autumn (I’m hoping to go to at least one of these):

- [Swift Connection](https://swiftconnection.io/) in Paris. This was great last year. No talk submissions yet.
- [SwiftLeeds](https://swiftleeds.co.uk/) in Leeds. [Talk submissions](https://swiftleeds.co.uk/cfp) are open for 2 more days.
- [Pragma](https://www.pragmaconference.com/) in Bologna. No details yet. Super early bird tickets available, and I checked by email that these are refundable until at least August. [Talk submissions](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdfqCRaIFLSFthBoaii92pStWueUFy-yHlgVySapLaew6h3Yg/viewform) are open until the end of June.
- [NSSpain](https://nsspain.com/) hasn’t been announced yet, but [sounds like](https://mastodon.social/@nsspain/114225388991317226) this will happen! A very sociable conference.
