On the iPhone, each article shows the title, a summary, and the website the article is from. On the iPad, the article text is shown in a simple two column layout with no distractions. The article title is ‘I Accidentally Uncovered a Nationwide Scam on Airbnb and the website it’s from is vice.com.’" />

Save webpages and text snippets to read in this fast and graceful iPad and iPhone app by [Douglas Hill](/). When you find an article on the web you’d like to read without being sidetracked from whatever you’re doing, save it in the app and come back to it at a better time. There’s no need to make an account because everything happens right on your device.

The reading experience is paramount. Saved articles are shown beautifully with a comfortable, distraction-free layout. Side-by-side pages mean you can focus on reading instead of scrolling. Multiple columns on iPad make effective use of the large screen and avoid long lines, which would be hard to read.

## Features

- Saves webpages for **offline reading**.
- **Cleans up webpages** by stripping out distracting parts so you can focus on the writing.
- Saves **text snippets**. Useful for long emails or to proof read your own writing.
- Keeps your data **privately** on your device. No online accounts.
- Shows text in **multiple columns** to make excellent use of larger screens and give a feel like a magazine or newspaper.
- Uses your preferred **Text Size** from the Settings app, including large accessibility sizes.
- Can optionally use the **system font** for best clarity.
- Supports **Dark Mode** specifically designed for reading in a dark room.
- Correctly lays out articles using **right-to-left** scripts such as Arabic and Hebrew.
- Is usable almost entirely from a **hardware keyboard** without touching the screen.
- Supports **accessibility** features including VoiceOver, Switch Control, Voice Control, and reduce motion.
- Exports really nice **PDFs** of articles. Take a screenshot and then select “Full Page”.
- Includes **Shortcuts actions** to add, find, extract data from, and delete articles.

## Roadmap

I’m pleased with the core reading experience but more needs to be created around that. The most important things I have to do are to add syncing between iPad and iPhone using iCloud (there will be no extra account or web service involved) and decide on a proper name for the app.
