On the iPhone, each article shows the title, a summary, and the website the article is from. On the iPad, the article text is shown in a simple two column layout with no distractions. The article title is ‘I Accidentally Uncovered a Nationwide Scam on Airbnb and the website it’s from is vice.com.’" />

This was a simple iPad and iPhone app by [Douglas Hill](/) for reading web articles, text snippets and ebooks. The app was available on Apple’s app store from December 2019 until May 2025, when I decided Apple’s control over software distribution was not the future I wanted.

When you found an article on the web you’d like to read without being sidetracked from whatever you were doing, you could save it in the app and come back to it at a better time. There was no need to make an account because everything happened right on your device.

The reading experience was paramount. Saved articles were shown beautifully with a comfortable, distraction-free layout. Side-by-side pages meant you could focus on reading instead of scrolling. Multiple columns on iPad made effective use of the large screen and avoided long lines, which would be hard to read.
