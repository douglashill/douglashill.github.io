I make apps to help people learn and achieve more. I’m the iOS team lead at [PSPDFKit](https://pspdfkit.com/) and an organiser of the [NSLondon meetup](https://nslondon.com/).

I’ve worked fully remotely since 2015 and [spent time as a digital nomad](https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2017/remote-work/), but these days [I don’t fly](/four-years-without-flying/) and instead base myself where I can go skiing, ice skating or wakeboarding.

If you like, you can [follow me](/follow/).

## Apps

- [Reading app](reading-app/): My simple app to save webpages to read later. The comfortable reading experience is paramount. This is my main side project.

- [PDF Viewer](https://itunes.apple.com/app/pdf-viewer-by-pspdfkit/id1120099014?mt=8): A powerful app to read, search, and annotate PDF documents. I make this with my teammates at [PSPDFKit](https://pspdfkit.com/).

- [Magic Spell](magicspell/): My handy Mac app to check spelling in many files at once. Not actively maintained.

- [Cambugs](https://itunes.apple.com/app/cambugs-letter-sounds/id574190228?mt=8): A suite of apps developed with educational psychologists to help teach children to become fluent readers.

## Code

- [KeyboardKit](https://github.com/douglashill/KeyboardKit): The easiest way to add comprehensive hardware keyboard control to an iPad or Mac Catalyst app. Read more: [The creation of KeyboardKit](status/1201265719788392448/) and [What’s new in KeyboardKit for iOS 14?](whats-new-in-keyboardkit-for-ios-14/)

- [DynamicButtonStack](https://github.com/douglashill/DynamicButtonStack): A UIKit view that lays out buttons in either a column or a row to suit the available space. Read more: [Motivation and design details](dynamic-button-stack/).
