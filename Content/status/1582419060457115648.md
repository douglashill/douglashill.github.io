I will probably buy the new iPad Pro because I spend about 1/3 of my life on 2018 iPad Pro, and I could really do with more performance for Slack in Safari. Should be a better version of my favourite computer ever.

That said, itâ€™s a shame they made the new iPad Pro look bad by fixing the front-facing camera position on the regular iPads but not on the Pros.
