Itâ€™s now possible to create `UIActivityViewController` (the share sheet) using `NSItemProvider` thanks to `UIActivityItemsConfiguration`. [developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiactivityitemsconfiguration](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiactivityitemsconfiguration)

The existing convention is to share multiple representations (e.g. URL and title) as separate items, and we should stop doing that because `NSItemProvider` offers a better way. But this means share and action extensions need updating to expect this.
