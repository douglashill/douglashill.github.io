Fantastic. The latest version of [@GitUpApp](https://twitter.com/GitUpApp) persists map view options. This will make every day a little bit better. [github.com/git-up/GitUp/pull/121](https://github.com/git-up/GitUp/pull/121)

Thatâ€™s these view options. I want them nearly the opposite of the defaults.
