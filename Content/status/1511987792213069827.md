The power delivered by the Apple Studio Display’s downstream USB‑C ports is curiously missing in the tech specs. One problem with the LG UltraFine 5k display is these ports only give 5–6W, which is pretty low for an iPad Pro. [apple.com/studio-display/specs/](https://www.apple.com/studio-display/specs/)
