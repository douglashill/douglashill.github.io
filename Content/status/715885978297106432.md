It seems the prompt to use iCloud in iBooks after updating to iOS 9.3 is the only chance to turn this feature on. [support.apple.com/en-gb/HT205751](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT205751)

I chose not to use iCloud because I was busy at the time. Now there’s no way for me to sync my books and PDFs. I’ll stick with Dropbox then.
