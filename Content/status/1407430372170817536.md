iOS 15 fixes pressing shift + up to select text ending up selecting to the start of the document when there is no glyph on the line above directly above the insertion point due to wrapping. Hard to explain but much appreciated.

As in, previously if you had the insertion point where the screenshot shows and pressed shift + up twice then the selection would be messed up, but now it works.
