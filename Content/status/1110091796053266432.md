Settling back into work after a fantastic time at [#TrySwiftConf](https://twitter.com/hashtag/TrySwiftConf). Nice variety of talks: not just about Swift. I appreciate talks on topics like mindset, design approach, and our professional community.

[#TrySwiftConf](https://twitter.com/hashtag/TrySwiftConf) brought together people from all over the world more so than European conferences. Additionally the vegan bento was so much better than WWDC boxed lunches. (There were also options with meat.)
