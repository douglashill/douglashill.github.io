I think this is the most minimal iOS 13 app using the new scene API that is set up in Objective-C rather than using a storyboard and `UIApplicationSceneManifest`. [gist.github.com/douglashill/1bd6ba60b50315455ed2b2381bc355dc](https://gist.github.com/douglashill/1bd6ba60b50315455ed2b2381bc355dc)

**25 minutes later:** If you declare a `UIApplicationSceneManifest` to specify the scene delegate, you can not have an app delegate at all.
