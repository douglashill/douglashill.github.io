My favourite feature on the iPad Pro is the four speakers: stereo now works in landscape.

My least favourite addition to the iPad Pro is the rubbish filling in spaces on the keyboard: \ | ^ ` and worst of all caps lock.

Software keyboard can do better. We can have different characters available for programming and for prose.
