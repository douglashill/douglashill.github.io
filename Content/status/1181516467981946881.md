Found out why iOS was not flagging ‘becuase’ as an incorrect spelling. I’d set up a manual text replacement becuase -&gt; because. However for some reason the spell checker doesn‘t flag text replacement trigger text. Makes no sense to me.

Now when I make that typo it is underlined red but doesn’t get corrected automatically. Can’t win.
