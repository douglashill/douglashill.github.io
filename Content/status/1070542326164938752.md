I’m very excited to share this side project I’ve been working on for a while: it’s a beautiful, modern read-later app designed primarily for iPad Pro. Join the TestFlight alpha at [douglashill.co/reading-app/](https://douglashill.co/reading-app/) and let me know what you think.

I’ve been struggling coming up with a name for the app, which has been putting me off sharing it. But I love the reading experience so much it’s selfish to keep this to myself.
