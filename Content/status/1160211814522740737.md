I can’t find a way to correctly implement a cancellable child view controller transition like `UINavigationController` does, because `endAppearanceTransition` doesn’t let you specify whether the transition was cancelled.

**2 hours later:** The solution for cancelling a child view controller transition is to call `beginAppearanceTransition` a second time when cancelling.

For the view that ends up staying visible:

    // When the transition starts.
    beginAppearanceTransition(false, animated: true)
    // When the transition is cancelled.
    beginAppearanceTransition(true, animated: false)
    endAppearanceTransition()

The solution to a warning log about ‘Unbalanced calls to begin/end appearance transitions’ was to take my balanced calls and unbalance them.
