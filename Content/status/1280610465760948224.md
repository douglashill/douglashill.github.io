One thing I can do on a Mac that I havenâ€™t worked out how to do on iOS is download an iOS beta installation profile so I can AirDrop it to my other devices. The system puts the profile straight in Settings rather than in your Downloads folder.

Otherwise you need to sign into the Apple developer website on every device, which is a bit tedious.
