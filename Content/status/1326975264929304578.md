I’m still puzzled why the iPhone 12 mini doesn’t render at its native size.

This is from [daringfireball.net/2020/11/the\_iphone\_12\_mini\_and\_iphone\_12\_pro\_max](https://daringfireball.net/2020/11/the_iphone_12_mini_and_iphone_12_pro_max)

But it doesn’t answer the question to me.

If running at the same size as the iPhone X is important, why don’t all new iPhones do this?

If there no need to worry about a 1:1 pixel ratio, wouldn’t it make sense to have a slider on all iPhones to let users pick whatever display density they find most comfortable? It would go a lot further than what Dynamic Type can do.
