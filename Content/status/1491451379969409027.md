Pull to refresh in Safari is one of those ideas that doesn’t work well in practice. I’m often losing entered data because I accidentally scroll or zoom out too far. (FB9687325)

Pull to refresh is OK if there’s a timeline with new posts on the top (as it was designed in Tweetie) and it 100% doesn‘t disrupt any state, but reloading a webpage is highly disruptive and there is often nothing special about the top.
