I found [@_readingapp](https://twitter.com/_readingapp) crashing opening an incredibly long article (a book) but only in landscape. It was a stack overflow. Fixed by changing from recursion to a loop. Feels like a student assignment, but there you go.

[@_readingapp](https://twitter.com/_readingapp) Surprising this didnâ€˜t come up before, but I suppose I just never opened an article needing over 1000 columns before. Even most books are shorter than this.
