Has anyone tried installing iTunes 12.6.5 on Catalina? (From [support.apple.com/en-us/HT208079](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208079)) Modifies a load of system folders so I have a feeling this will either not work or break things.

Why you may ask? Weâ€™ve had multiple reports and confirmed ourselves that having a certain app installed means PDFs can no longer be opened in [@pdfviewerapp](https://twitter.com/pdfviewerapp). We believe this is due to it corrupting the file type associations so would like to look at its Info.plist.
