New in iOS 15: iPhone apps that only support portrait appear the right way up on a landscape iPad. I donâ€™t need to use my banks sideways anymore! ðŸ™ƒ

This leads me to think that being able to put iPhone apps in Split View and Slide Over would be a nice next step.

Or more apps could support iPad. Itâ€™s as easy as Mac Catalyst: You just have to check the iPad checkbox. Right!? ðŸ˜‡
