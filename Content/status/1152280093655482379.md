My objection to these contextual menus is having the icons on the trailing side means you can’t do a quick vertical scan. There’s no vertical focus line for the eye to follow. [twitter.com/mergesort/status/1152274192198459394](https://twitter.com/mergesort/status/1152274192198459394)

But I love the idea of having a consistent menu design.
