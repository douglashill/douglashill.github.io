We launched PSPDFKit Instant today, which makes it easy to build apps that sync PDFs. [pspdfkit.com/blog/2017/pspdfkit-instant/](https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2017/pspdfkit-instant/)

Instant has very cool real-time collaboration, and you can try it out at [pspdfkit.com/instant/try/](https://pspdfkit.com/instant/try/)

I’ve been working mostly on the Instant iOS framework but also the product as a whole. I’ve learned a lot seeing all the parts fit together.
