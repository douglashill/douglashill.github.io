It’s now possible to buy train etickets in south-east England, but stations don’t necessarily have anything to read them. You can wave your phone at a ticket officer, who just sort of assumes it’s okay I guess and tells the guard at the ticket gate to let you through.

App idea: generate wallet passes that look about right and show today’s date.
