I only just realised you can use Wi-Fi calling to receive text messages. I’m going to turn this on briefly to receive SMS security codes at home where we have at best 1 bar of 3G.

(I wouldn’t turn Wi-Fi calling on all the time because it puts too much text in the status bar on iPhones with home buttons.)
