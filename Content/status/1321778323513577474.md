Don’t panic. DON’T PANIC!

There is so much wrong here. Apple says you can view exposure notifications in the app, but the NHS app doesn’t actually do this. After the system notifications are gone, the info is not recorded anywhere.

I don’t know on what basis they decided the risk is low. I’d like to know the date, duration and signal strength, but it doesn’t tell me.
