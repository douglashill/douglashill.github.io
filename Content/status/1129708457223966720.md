Spot the bug in this `UIView` subclass. Bonus points if you know what happens and why this actually works most of the time. I’ll post the answer later today.

To clarify the scope: it’s directly inside the subclass so `pageControl` is a property.

**10 hours later:** What happens:

1. self is valid… but weird (curried?)
2. The target param is typed `Any?` so self is OK.
3. The target is set as `NSNull` somehow.
4. This is a nil-targeted action (traverses the responder chain). My view is usually on the responder chain so still receives the action.
