Say in the Apple TV iPad app I want to get from an item in Up Next that’s available on Prime Video to that item’s detail page to buy it from iTunes Movies. Easiest way seems to be: contextual menu > Share > [@OpenerApp](https://twitter.com/OpenerApp) > Open Link in Apple TV

Opener is such a useful tool, not just for gluing apps together but for gluing apps back to themselves.
