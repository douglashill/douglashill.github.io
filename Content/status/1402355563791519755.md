I asked in the Core Data lab about full text search. I thought this would be about text normalisation, stemming, and most efficient query structure, but no: Let Spotlight do the hard work with `NSCoreDataCoreSpotlightDelegate`. Then use this for in-app search with `CSSearchQuery`. ðŸ˜Ž

The session on Core Data full text search will go up tomorrow [developer.apple.com/wwdc21/10098](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/10098)

The sample code for Core Data full text search is up now: [developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata/nspersistentstorecoordinator/showcase\_app\_data\_in\_spotlight](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata/nspersistentstorecoordinator/showcase_app_data_in_spotlight)
