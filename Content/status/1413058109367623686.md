Iâ€™ve been rapidly switching the default web browser on my iPad on the iOS 15 beta between Safari and Firefox. Unfortunately neither is stable and polished enough at this point for my work.

On the other hand, the improved keyboard control on iOS 15 such as being able to toggle Slide Over from the keyboard is a big productivity boost even on the beta.
