As expected, the Xcode 14 release candidate reverts to the macOS 12 and Catalyst 15 SDKs. To get your Swift code compiling for both iOS and Mac:

    #if canImport(RoomPlan)
    // Use iOS 16 or macOS 13 API
    #endif

It’s a bit more obvious in Objective-C:

    #ifdef __IPHONE_16_0
    // Use iOS 16 or macOS 13 API
    #endif

We’ve been doing this since June so our code compiles with any of Xcode 13, Xcode 14 beta, and the Xcode 14 release candidate.
