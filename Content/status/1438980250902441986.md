AirPods on Nintendo Switch:

- Good 👍
- Goes louder than the Switch will drive my wired headphones 📈
- Feels strange after many years playing games with wired over-ear headphones 😮
- Fun to try with the music player in Super Smash Bros! 🎶

It’s a peculiar weakness of the Switch that the headphone jack is so quiet. Testing with the same headphones, the Switch is considerably quieter than the Nintendo DS Lite.

**16 hours later:** More observations about AirPods on Switch:

- Works while the console is docked, and audio playback is uninterrupted when docking and undocking.
- Latency is worse when you look out for it carefully, but I don’t think it will be a problem in most cases.
