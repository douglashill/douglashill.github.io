Using a mouse on iPad, I click the wrong app in the dock multiple times a day. It’s hard to judge the horizontal movement required because of magnetism and the pointer being hidden. The HIG says use the lift effect for small elements only, and I think app icons are a bit too big.

I’m trying disabling pointer animations in accessibility settings for now.
