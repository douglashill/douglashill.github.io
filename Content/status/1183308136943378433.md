One support agent at [@StarlingBank](https://twitter.com/StarlingBank) is telling me that the app crashing when logging is an intentional security meansure against jailbroken devices — without asking if my device is jailbroken (it’s not).

[@StarlingBank](https://twitter.com/StarlingBank) To be fair I opened a different support ticket for a different crash and was told it was forwarded to the engineering team, which is a great response. 👍
