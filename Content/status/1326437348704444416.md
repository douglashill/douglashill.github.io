Does everyone need to verify an iCloud account in the iOS Simulator *every day* by entering the password in Settings, or only me?

**21 minutes later:** Looking at this more I think my iCloud account in the Simulator is permanently slightly broken. Can’t even sign out (except by deleting the whole simulator). I’m guessing if I ignore these password prompts it will work just as well as if I enter the password.
