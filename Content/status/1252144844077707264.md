Is there a nicer way to do a ‘lazy let’ property in Swift other than these 7 lines? I can’t see how to do this with property wrappers.

- It needs to be lazy because of the cyclic dependency with self.
- I know it’s not thread safe. This is UI so it’s fine.
- In practice I’d stick with var and hopefully remember not to set it.

**6 hours later:** The ideal case would be if this ‘just worked’. The language has syntax for expressing lazy let but the compiler doesn’t like it for some reason.

**1 day later:** Outcome of lazy let:

- You can do it with a property wrapper. ([gist.github.com/douglashill/accde7f3db06b33a37f1389e32d293b1](https://gist.github.com/douglashill/accde7f3db06b33a37f1389e32d293b1))
- It doesn‘t work for me because the property initialiser (closure capture) runs before self is available. The reason for using lazy was to break this cyclic dependency.
