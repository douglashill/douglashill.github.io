I see a lot of misinformation repeated about `PHPickerViewController` and `UIImagePickerController` (including from Apple).

`UIImagePickerController` hasn’t required the app to have permission to access the photo library since iOS 11. For picking a single image, it provides exactly the same user experience as `PHPickerViewController`, including supporting search.

`PHPickerViewController` does offer a slightly more granular callback API so the image can load without blocking the user.

If your app requires iOS 14 or you need multiple selection, use `PHPickerViewController`. If you support older versions, I think there’s little benefit having conditional code paths to support both pickers.
