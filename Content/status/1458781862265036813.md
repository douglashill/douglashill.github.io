23 Oct 2021: I release a version of my AutoSave extension for Panic’s Nova that works properly. [github.com/douglashill/nova-autosave](https://github.com/douglashill/nova-autosave)

8 Nov 2021: Panic releases Nova 8, which has automatic saving as a built-in feature.

Good outcome in the end. I can take away learning a bit of JavaScript, but I kind of wish I’d waited a couple of weeks.
