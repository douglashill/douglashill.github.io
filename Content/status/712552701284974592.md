So I need to active my iPhone after updating to iOS 9.3, and the activation server is temporarily unavailable.

Try a bit later and it activates — after forgetting the email address and password I just typed.

Then as soon as the home screen appears I’m thrown into the iOS update flow thingy and have to enter my iCloud password for a third time.

Then I see the patronising ‘Welcome to iPhone’ message. I don’t blame normal people for ignoring software updates.
