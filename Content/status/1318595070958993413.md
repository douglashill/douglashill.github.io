We’re about to hit the end of the 4 year Keyboard Service Program for early buyers of the 2016 MacBook Pro. Now’s the time to get those top cases replaced… if there are any appointments available and if it’s safe to go out.

The MBP I bought in 2016 is in need of it’s third keyboard replacement. My current 2018 model has needed it’s first replacement since around March but it hasn’t been easy to arrange that.
