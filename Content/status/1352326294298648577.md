Just learned from [@atpfm](https://twitter.com/atpfm) that the Apple Feedback app is built into iOS. To open it you must navigate to applefeedback:// in Safari. üßê

The app is:

- Not on home screen
- Not in App Library
- Can‚Äôt find with Spotlight
- Not on App Store
- Disappears from the app switcher when you switch away, even if paired with another app in Split View
- Disappears from Slide Over when swiped away

From which it seems:

- Apple loves receiving our feedback.
- Secret URLs are cool, I guess.
