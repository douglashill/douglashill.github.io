It’s five years to the day since I started work at [@PSPDFKit](https://twitter.com/PSPDFKit) as a junior-ish developer. I’ve learned sooooo much. How nice to wake up every morning and work with such a great team.

**21 minutes later:** It’s also one year since the weekend of arriving at WWDC. Last year was a really fun one. Saturday is best for adjusting to the time zone and starting catching up with people. And maybe visiting adorable bunnies.

**23 hours later:** On this day last year, [@smileyborg](https://twitter.com/smileyborg) and [@krstnfx](https://twitter.com/krstnfx) organised a behind-the-scenes Worldwide Costco Tour (WWCT). Fun afternoon, and a truly novel icebreaker for WWDC week.
