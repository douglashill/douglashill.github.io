I looked into presenting action sheets and activity view controllers, and wrote about some unexpected things I found: [pspdfkit.com/blog/2016/popovers-on-popovers/](https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2016/popovers-on-popovers/)

It all started with this [twitter.com/steipete/status/755409285111218180](https://twitter.com/steipete/status/755409285111218180)

Then I saw this and couldnâ€™t reproduce it. [twitter.com/jesse\_squires/status/755415278658334721](https://twitter.com/jesse_squires/status/755415278658334721)

Eventually found reading a property changed behaviour, so I wrote a Radar. [openradar.appspot.com/27448488](http://openradar.appspot.com/27448488)

And in the end I could not reproduce what Pages did, so another Radar. [openradar.appspot.com/27448912](http://openradar.appspot.com/27448912)
