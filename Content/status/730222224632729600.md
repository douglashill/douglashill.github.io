`NSNotificationCenter` docs: “The method specified by notificationSelector must have one and only one argument”

[developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSNotificationCenter\_Class/index.html#//apple\_ref/occ/instm/NSNotificationCenter/addObserver:selector:name:object](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSNotificationCenter_Class/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/NSNotificationCenter/addObserver:selector:name:object):

I often see that `NSNotificationCenter` API violated by using selectors without any arguments.
