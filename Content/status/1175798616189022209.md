Does anyone know why companies set up *synchronous* text chat for support? It’s seems like the worst of both worlds. Both parties have to be present at the same time and you have to type.

**14 hours later:** I think I wasn’t clear my main point is: why is asynchronous chat often not an option for those that want it? And if you build a chat system right it works great sync and async (e.g. Intercom).
