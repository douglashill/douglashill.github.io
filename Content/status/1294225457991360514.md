Clearly Twitter is the future of documentation with [@SceneStorage](https://twitter.com/SceneStorage). Also, I respect this Twitter list: [twitter.com/i/lists/1080339436682924032](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1080339436682924032)

Ugh the list link seems to (usually) not work. Look where [@SceneStorage](https://twitter.com/SceneStorage) is listed — it’s fun!
