Over the last ten days, COVID exposure notifications comprised **a quarter** of my iPhone’s battery use. Not sure if this is normal, but kind of awkward given this feature is so important for everyone. Still worth it though.

The energy usage seems relatively worse because I really really don’t go out much. 99% of the time, running exposure notifications isn’t doing anything useful. Hopefully something that can be optimised in an update.
