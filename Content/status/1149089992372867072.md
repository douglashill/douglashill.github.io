I fully agree. My impression was that the staff were deliberately trying to make attendees feel uncomfortable, which is not cool, especially considering the price to attend. However this may be a cultural misunderstanding. [twitter.com/iKenndac/status/1148980212341837826](https://twitter.com/iKenndac/status/1148980212341837826)

The other thing I find mildly culturally insensitive about WWDC is they keep giving me a United Kingdom flag pin like everyone is expected to associate with a single country, and for that to be a positive association. (But itâ€™s just a pin: I can easily get rid of it.)
