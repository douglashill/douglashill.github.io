Was thinking about this while watching the Xenoblade 2 Nintendo Direct on my Switch. In some ways it’s better for video than my 13" iPad. [twitter.com/craigmod/status/928880199399178240](https://twitter.com/craigmod/status/928880199399178240)

The Switch comes with a remote control and kickstand. It’s a better mini TV.
