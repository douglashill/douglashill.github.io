Reminder that much trouble was reported with the first gen LG UltraFine 5k display. The USB ports donâ€™t work reliably on mine: it only charges my iPhone if my Mac is also plugged in, and the lightning connector it the right way up. Same cable works fine both ways up anywhere else

Also 5K is really cold
