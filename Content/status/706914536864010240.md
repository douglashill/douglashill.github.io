Trying to stop my iPad from spending weeks uploading photos that already exist in iCloud. Tried lots of things but everything is failing.

It’s getting ridiculous. I can’t even erase the iPad to start from scratch. It fails because ‘The connection to iCloud timed out’.

**20 minutes later:** I managed to erase the iPad using Find My iPad on [icloud.com](http://icloud.com). Now restoring it from a backup of another (working) device.
