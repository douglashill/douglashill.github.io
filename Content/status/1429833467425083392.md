When using `Timer` or `CADisplayLink` I’m always confused if I want the common or default RunLoop Mode. Summary:

- `.default` — only runs when touches are not being tracked
- `.tracking` — only runs when touches are being tracked
- `.common` — runs whether touches are being tracked or not

A *common* bug is that a timer or display link isn’t firing while scrolling. Fix this by changing the run loop mode from default to *common*.
