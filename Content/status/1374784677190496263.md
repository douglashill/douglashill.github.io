Remember all the fuss about Zoom running a secret web server on your computer? Looks like Figma does it too for the same reason: to open links without repeated confirmation. [help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039956894](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039956894)

Every time you open the Figma app, FigmaAgent is started again and added to Login Items. If you donâ€™t need Figma to show fonts on your computer and opening links manually is fine, then removing FigmaAgent is an option.

This seems to work for removing FigmaAgent:

- Force Quit it in Activity Monitor
- Remove it in System Preferences &gt; Users &amp; Groups &gt; Login Items
- Delete ~/Library/Application Support/Figma/FigmaAgent.app
- Delete /Applications/Figma.app/Contents/Library/FigmaAgent.app

Figma is a great design tool, and the good news is that at least for me it seems to operate fine without its agent.
