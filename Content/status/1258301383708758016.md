My Apple Store purchase failed. My options for retrying are a card number I don’t recognise or enter card details. But my correct card details are already on the account! It would seem like phishing except I’m being linked to this website from the Apple Store app.

**48 minutes later:** This ended up being my card’s Apple Pay device account number on my iPad mini. I have no insight into why the payment failed and had to enter my card details that Apple already has on file so not ideal :(
