As an iOS developer, I’m worried about the number of services I use where I chose the website in Safari on iPad over the app. Been like this with GitHub and Basecamp for ages. Recently switched away from the Slack iPad app too.

Even though the feel is often all wrong, so much great UX comes for free with websites: select/copy more text, everything is scalable by default in a more simple way than Dynamic Type, automatic dark mode thanks to Noir, bookmarks, sending what you’re looking at to someone else.
