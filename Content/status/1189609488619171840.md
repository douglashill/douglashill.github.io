Weâ€™ve seen strange interaction between `UIKeyCommand` and text input for a while. Which one gets the event is not intuitive and sometimes somehow neither gets the event! My guess would be this is because these key commands were newly added in the Twitter app [macstories.net/stories/twitter-ipad-apps-upgraded-with-multiwindow-support-keyboard-navigation/](https://www.macstories.net/stories/twitter-ipad-apps-upgraded-with-multiwindow-support-keyboard-navigation/) [twitter.com/NolanOBrien/status/1189585020232462340](https://twitter.com/NolanOBrien/status/1189585020232462340)
