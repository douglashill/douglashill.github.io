What app should I use to mark places on a map I’d be interested in going to or went to and were good? Privately just for me.

So far I’ve used Apple Maps favourites but it’s quite broken:

- Can only favourite small areas rather than POI.
- [Un]favouriting sometimes just doesn’t work.
- Sync is unreliable.

You might not notice the small area problem in a place where things are spread out, like much of the US. However in a dense environment like Hong Kong a ‘favourite’ can cover 20 different businesses.
