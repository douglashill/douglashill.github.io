Hereâ€™s a write up of everything new in KeyboardKit for iOSÂ 14. It has support for Swift Package Manager, sidebars, and lists with `UICollectionView`. [douglashill.co/whats-new-in-keyboardkit-for-ios-14/](https://douglashill.co/whats-new-in-keyboardkit-for-ios-14/)

The demo app has been updated to use a sidebar. Everything shown in this screenshot can be used from a keyboard.

Using tab and arrow keys to change focused column in a split view was really tricky to get right. So glad itâ€™s finally working well. ðŸ˜Œ
