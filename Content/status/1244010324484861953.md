‚å®Ô∏èüåè KeyboardKit is now localised into 39 languages! I wrote about how I leveraged Apple‚Äôs glossary files to achieve this: [douglashill.co/localisation-using-apples-glossaries/](https://douglashill.co/localisation-using-apples-glossaries/)

**21 minutes later:** Also, my site now has an articles feed: [douglashill.co/feed.json](https://douglashill.co/feed.json)

**3 days later:** KeyboardKit now honours the reduce motion accessibly setting for scrolling and zooming animations. I also added what I‚Äôm calling the classic demo; it runs back to iOS 11 and confirms stuff works from Objective-C.

The goal with all these changes ‚Äî 39 localisations, iOS 11, Objective-C support ‚Äî is to eliminate potential barriers to adoption. I want there to be no excuses for apps to not have excellent hardware keyboard control.

**2 days later:** One fun part / obstacle when poking through Apple‚Äôs localisation glossaries is learning app code names.
