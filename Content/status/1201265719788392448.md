From 1‚Äì24 December 2019, I published open source code every day. Most days, these efforts focused on hardware keyboard control in iOS apps, which came together as [KeyboardKit](https://github.com/douglashill/KeyboardKit). This article collects my daily updates.

**1 Dec:** Open advent calendar or open source? Here‚Äôs a a `UIScrollView` subclass that allows scrolling using a hardware keyboard. Supports arrows, option + arrows, command + arrows, space bar, page up/down, home/end. [gist.github.com/douglashill/5e843adf1451f67d75d631b3bff45a96](https://gist.github.com/douglashill/5e843adf1451f67d75d631b3bff45a96)

**2 Dec:** I wanted to open source something else today, even if it‚Äôs small. Here‚Äôs a `UITabBarController` subclass that allows navigating between tabs using cmd+1, cmd+2 etc. on a hardware keyboard. [gist.github.com/douglashill/e9e2876f755271ff3ac323c3f02da092](https://gist.github.com/douglashill/e9e2876f755271ff3ac323c3f02da092)

**3 Dec:** Today I‚Äôve brought together `KeyboardTableView`, `KeyboardScrollView` and `KeyboardTabBarController` into a new open source framework to help apps support being controlled using a hardware keyboard. I‚Äôm calling it KeyboardKit. [github.com/douglashill/KeyboardKit](https://github.com/douglashill/KeyboardKit)

**4 Dec:** Today for open source advent, I added support for paging scroll views in KeyboardKit. Also made the example app look way more fun.

**5 Dec:** Updated `KeyboardTableView` in KeyboardKit to support arrow key navigation with multiple sections. It also wraps around to the top/bottom. [github.com/douglashill/KeyboardKit](https://github.com/douglashill/KeyboardKit)

**6 Dec:** Added support in KeyboardKit for basic app/window commands:

- New window (cmd + N)
- Close window (cmd + W)
- Cycle keyboard focus between visible windows (cmd + `)
- Show app settings in the Settings app (cmd + ,)

**7 Dec:** A `UITextView` subclass joins the KeyboardKit family, speeding up text manipulation with:

- Find next/previous (cmd + G)
- Use selection for find (cmd + E)
- Jump to selection (cmd + J)

**8 Dec:** I noticed a string encoding error saving a particular article in [@_readingapp](https://twitter.com/_readingapp). For some reason it can be interpreted as ASCII but not UTF-8 ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Fixed it with a function that brute forces encodings to read a string from a file. Here it is: [gist.github.com/douglashill/0e693ccc94c292171cfe48770d23a4a0](https://gist.github.com/douglashill/0e693ccc94c292171cfe48770d23a4a0)

**9 Dec:** It‚Äôs so easy in AppKit to set a `keyEquivalent` on an `NSMenuItem`. `KeyboardNavigationController` brings the same API to `UIBarButtonItem` in UIKit, so it only takes a few lines to have actions in the nav bar and toolbar accessible from a hardware keyboard. [github.com/douglashill/KeyboardKit/blob/master/KeyboardKit/KeyboardNavigationController.swift](https://github.com/douglashill/KeyboardKit/blob/master/KeyboardKit/KeyboardNavigationController.swift)

**10 Dec:** More open source advent. Added key equivalents for system bar button items so you get automatic hardware keyboard support with no extra lines of code. cmd + S for Save cmd + R for Reply etc. [github.com/douglashill/KeyboardKit/blob/master/KeyboardKit/KeyboardBarButtonItem.swift](https://github.com/douglashill/KeyboardKit/blob/master/KeyboardKit/KeyboardBarButtonItem.swift)

**11 Dec:** KeyboardKit‚Äôs `UIScrollView` subclass now uses a custom animator based on `CADisplayLink`. It‚Äôs smoother, faster, and interacts better with finger scrolling. [github.com/douglashill/KeyboardKit/blob/master/KeyboardKit/PointAnimator.swift](https://github.com/douglashill/KeyboardKit/blob/master/KeyboardKit/PointAnimator.swift)

**12 Dec:** I added zooming support to KeyboardKit‚Äôs scroll view.

Q: How many key commands for Zoom In and Zoom Out?

A: If you want it to show a proper plus and minus sign and match Safari then it‚Äôs five!

**13 Dec:** Here‚Äôs what I use in [@_readingapp](https://twitter.com/_readingapp) to smooth over AppKit/UIKit API differences. This file shrinks each June üëç [gist.github.com/douglashill/884e0eacb42c5a3b7b359ac888cffaa2](https://gist.github.com/douglashill/884e0eacb42c5a3b7b359ac888cffaa2)

Wanted to share this after seeing [twitter.com/steipete/status/1205556227071184896](https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1205556227071184896)

**14 Dec:** More open source: I resurrected my nearly 3 year old PR adding a text size setting to GitUp since the project is accepting contributions now. [github.com/git-up/GitUp/pull/620](https://github.com/git-up/GitUp/pull/620)

(My fork has this feature already and several other enhancements. Best Git app! [github.com/douglashill/GitUp/releases](https://github.com/douglashill/GitUp/releases))

**15 Dec:** Still going with open source advent. Over half way through! I added the ability to dismiss any popover or sheet with the escape key (or cmd + .). Any UIKit app can get this by using the `UIWindow` subclass in KeyboardKit. [github.com/douglashill/KeyboardKit/blob/master/KeyboardKit/KeyboardWindow.swift](https://github.com/douglashill/KeyboardKit/blob/master/KeyboardKit/KeyboardWindow.swift)

**16 Dec:** By refactoring KeyboardKit‚Äôs scroll view key handling to use composition rather than inheritance, it became trivial to add page up, page down, home and end for table view and text view. It‚Äôll make other things easier later. [github.com/douglashill/KeyboardKit/commit/2a76fd78259657e3b76f304f18ea3f1472bdc059](https://github.com/douglashill/KeyboardKit/commit/2a76fd78259657e3b76f304f18ea3f1472bdc059)

**17 Dec:** Open source advent: Added refreshing in scroll views (including table views) with cmd + R. Automatic if they‚Äôre hooked up with a `UIRefreshControl`. Easy with yesterday‚Äôs refactoring. I promise I‚Äôll stop tweeting everything after 24th :) [github.com/douglashill/KeyboardKit/commit/cf4cbd860ab14efd27b00ca307c613342d76d399](https://github.com/douglashill/KeyboardKit/commit/cf4cbd860ab14efd27b00ca307c613342d76d399)

**18 Dec:** Added something to KeyboardKit that many apps get wrong: now it doesn‚Äôt let key commands override text input. E.g. so cmd¬†+¬†left moves the cursor to the beginning of a line instead sending the event to some view underneath and losing user input like in Apple‚Äôs Calendar app.

**19 Dec:** Open source advent: Added support for iOS 11 to KeyboardKit.

**20 Dec:** Big one today: I added initial arrow key selection in `UICollectionView`. Of course it gets the other KeyboardKit goodness like ‚åòR to refresh and Page¬†Up etc. to scroll.

**21 Dec:** Added `UITableViewController` and `UICollectionViewController` subclasses in KeyboardKit for easier integration when using these instead of making the views directly. Also this: [twitter.com/daringfireball/status/1208122840265973760](https://twitter.com/daringfireball/status/1208122840265973760)

**22 Dec:** First KeyboardKit pull request merged: thanks to [@pedrommcarrasco](https://twitter.com/pedrommcarrasco) the framework is now available on CocoaPods. [cocoapods.org/pods/Keyboard-Kit](https://cocoapods.org/pods/Keyboard-Kit)

**23 Dec:** Nearly at the end of my open source advent. Today I improved KeyboardKit‚Äôs arrow key navigation in collection views:

- Holding option jumps to the far end in any direction.
- Selection wraps to the next line with `UICollectionViewFlowLayout`.

**24 Dec:** It‚Äôs the end of my open source advent. I added using the delete key to delete items in a `UITableView`. It‚Äôs automatic if you‚Äôre using the older `commitEditingStyle` API. Now it‚Äôs time for a few days off!
