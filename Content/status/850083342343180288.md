WhatsApp messages received between backing up an old iPhone and authorising the app on a new iPhone are lost. Gone.

You can’t even see them on the old device as it gets deauthorised.

It’s crazy to me that WhatsApp is so popular despite lacking access from any device with a consistent view of your data.
