Spend a while looking into Swift selector syntax not working with properties. Eventually found this proposal [github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0064-property-selectors.md](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0064-property-selectors.md)

As a workaround for now, I think Iâ€™m going to declare some read-only properties as functions instead. Seems least horrible.
