My past tweets are now available on my website. No sign in required. In the URL, replace “twitter.com/qdoug” with “douglashill.co”.

## Examples

- [douglashill.co/status/1184397800211173376](/status/1184397800211173376/)
- [douglashill.co/status/1253232498475180033](/status/1253232498475180033/)
- [douglashill.co/status/1262708246017716225](/status/1262708246017716225/)
- [douglashill.co/status/1576939421320024065](/status/1576939421320024065/)
- [douglashill.co/status/1429833467425083392](/status/1429833467425083392/)

## Limitations

- No usable archive. I should add this.
- Images are missing descriptions (alt text) because this seems to be missing in the Twitter data export. Don’t know how I can get this except manually or by paying for the Twitter API for a month. 🙀
- Quoted tweets are just links. Same problem as above with accessing this data.
- <strike>Threads/tweetstorms only include the first two tweets. I didn’t yet write proper code to pull out this data.</strike>
- Some formatting is off because my website assumes input is Markdown.

## Deliberate omissions

- Recent posts, because this content is already available on either [douglashill.co](https://douglashill.co/) or [pub.douglashill.co](https://pub.douglashill.co/) with more meaningful URLs.
- Retweets, because these aren’t that valuable to preserve.
- Mentions, because these aren’t that valuable to preserve.
- Replies to myself don’t have their own page, because threads/tweetstorms are combined into single pages.
