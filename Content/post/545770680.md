> Fonts now scale after rotation

We even have improvements even in the iPhone version in what is mostly an iPad update!

I really love reading these design insight posts, and the new iPad design looks incredible. I kind of sort of want one now…

I am still not sure why I want Instapaper to work well in landscape. I just like the idea of apps looking great however you hold the device even though landscape is not usually practical for reading. 

Not making the text huge is a great improvement to the landscape experience in Instapaper. The main thing left to fix is the thickness of the toolbar. (It stays as thick as in portrait — many apps use a less tall toolbar when in landscape.)

I’m still wondering: what if the toolbar was removed entirely in landscape to maximise reading height? Rotate to portrait if you need controls.
