Holding it this way, we can use the volume up button as the shutter button. I have drawn a ring around the position of the camera lens: not the best location. I imagine that I may end up holding the camera as I always have (home button on the right), and then I would either use the software shutter button or press volume up with my left hand. Can’t tell without trying it. 

John Gruber and Dan Benjamin discussed this (and much more) in [The Talk Show 46][TS], which was an excellent episode. John thinks the ‘most elegant’ way to include a physical shutter button would be to add a dedicated button on the opposite side of the device to the volume up button. I agree.
