[Jacqui Cheng at Ars Technica on Steve Jobs’ Letter on Flash:](http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2010/04/poll-technica-steve-jobs-letter-on-flash.ars)

> Jobs makes the concession that iPhone OS users won’t be able to play Flash games, but says that there are plenty of other games on the App Store. (Someone let me know when there’s a version of [Winterbells](http://www.ferryhalim.com/orisinal/g3/bells.htm) for iPhone.)

Playing games from [Orisinal](http://www.ferryhalim.com/orisinal/) on the [Wii](http://www.nintendo.com/wii/channels/internetchannel) is the best thing about Flash. I particularly enjoy [Winterbells](http://www.ferryhalim.com/orisinal/g3/bells.htm) and [A Daily Cup of Tea](http://www.ferryhalim.com/orisinal/g3/tea.htm).
