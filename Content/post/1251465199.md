[Skype Blog - Skype now available for Android phones:](http://blogs.skype.com/en/2010/10/android.html)

> Skype has been tested on HTC and Motorola devices with Android OS 2.1 and above. It may work on other Android phones, but we can’t guarantee full functionality or compatibility. 

John Gruber posted this quotation on the [Daring Fireball Linked List](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/10/05/skype-android). I don’t think there is anything deeper here (about Android platform fragmentation). Skype is just cautious about what is officially supported. 

I was given this message when I opened the Skype app today:

![Screen shot of iPhone alert titled: ‘Warning’ and then “This version of Skype is only supported on unmodified iPhone OS 3.0.x, 3.1.x, and 3.2.x”](tumblr_l9u8do8z2V1qb1802.jpg)

[As warned](/post/968531743), the latest version of the Skype app is not supported on iOS 4 on an iPhone 3G. It works fine for me though.
