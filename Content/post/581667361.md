I found this article sitting in what I call my Tumblr Postbox. I should have included it in my previous post on iPhone OS 4 Background Processing. Here's what he says:

> Basically, the task switcher is a tiny version of the Springboard that shows what amounts to a random selection of your apps

> […]

> Say, you’re writing an e-mail while referring to a Wikipedia article; the task switcher allows you to quickly jump between the two applications instead of having to go through the Springboard, which would take a few seconds longer.
 
> […]

> it seems to me that the few situations where the task switcher is useful do not warrant adding an entirely new way of opening applications.

This is almost exactly what I think. The case of rapidly switching between just two applications is interesting, so I have written about it in my [next post](/post/581749422).
