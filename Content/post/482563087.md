Some interface commentary:

The iPad contacts app takes the right hand side from the Mac’s Address Book where we have mouse hover feedback. [There is no hovering on the iPad.](http://camerondaigle.com/v1/articles/podcamp_nashville_2010_presentation/) I might be wrong, but I don’t think the blue tint was there on the emails and addresses in earlier screen shots so I think Apple have given this some thought. Do you think the tint is enough to show these items are tappable or should these items be buttons or underlined as links?

(Phone numbers are not tappable on the iPad, of course.)
