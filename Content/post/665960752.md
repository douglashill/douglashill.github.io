I just submitted this idea to Tapbots. 

When launching Pastebot, it could import the most recent image from the photo library as well as the current item on the clipboard. 

This would be very useful for getting screen shots from my iPhone to my Mac. Currently I need to:

- Take the screen shot
- Open Photos and copy the latest image
- Open Pastebot and ‘push’ the just imported image onto my Mac

The middle step could be removed if Pastebot always grabbed the most recent image in the library. I am not concerned about clutter; I want Pastebot to grab as much data as possible.
