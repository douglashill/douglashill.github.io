[Marco Arment, regarding removing Adobe Flash entirely from Safari:][marco]

> beachballing and crashing my browser are major inconveniences that I’m happy to avoid

I don’t find I have this problem, although I do use [ClickToFlash][1] so Flash only loads on request. Even so, when Flash content is shown, I never find it causing anything to hang and I can not think of one occasion where Flash has crashed. Furthermore, it is supposed to be impossible for a plugin to crash Safari itself because plugins run as separate processes (since Snow Leopard).
