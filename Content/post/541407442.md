John Gruber, Daring Fireball, regarding off-campus testing of pre-release Apple products: 

> Such units are not allowed to be demonstrated or revealed to anyone. Not friends, not spouses.

Pretty tough but fair, I think. 

The whole article is informative and engaging. I'm not summarising it here, just sharing a thought on that quotation. 

I imagine you would have to carry both a regular iPhone and the test model around all the time to avoid having to be creative with your excuses if someone wants to see something on your iPhone.  

Here are some initial thoughts on the sort of excuses that can be avoided:

- “it's running out of power”
- “I've forgotten my passcode lock” 
- “one of my family members just remote wiped it”
