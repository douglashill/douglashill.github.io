An alternative to using the standard iOS back button in the iPhone’s iPod app (Music on the iPod Touch).

> You can actually just swipe anywhere on the album art from left to right to push the album art off the screen and slide back to the list view.

I’ve known about this for a long time.

I'm fascinated by the inclusion of this gesture; it is very unlike the standard interaction with the iPhone (which is primarily composed of tapping buttons and scrolling). I think this way of going back is a remnant of an interaction model that (mostly) didn't make it out of the lab: one where you slide across to go back to previous columns in a navigation stack. I could be wrong.
