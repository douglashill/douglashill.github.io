An iPhone 4 arrived in the post about two weeks ago. It is very good. Spectacular, even. I hope to write more about it at some point, but things are busy in term time, as always.

There were two very attractive reasons for upgrading from an iPhone 3G: more speed and a better camera. I am more than pleased with both.

Simplenote is a shining example — just one example — of an app transformed on iPhone 4. The power of the device, combined with fast app switching and background task completion, turn it into a new app. Now it is so fast to jot down a quick note or check one from earlier, I actually do these things a lot. Simplenote is many times more useful to me now.

As a camera, iPhone 4 is hugely fun. The greater quality of the photographs seems to push the device over the edge to a far more useful and satisfying camera compared to the iPhone 3G. I expect to post far more photos here on Tumblr, and to share more with my friends on Facebook.

To be clear, I still think the iPhone 3G is excellent and I would still be happy with it. My new toy is really a luxury. So, what makes me most content with the upgrade to iPhone 4 is that my iPhone 3G isn’t being wasted. My brother has it now. Hopefully he’s putting it to good use.
