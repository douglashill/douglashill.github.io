To my surprise and delight, I learned something new from Apple’s iPhone tips page:

> #### Get back to your draft.
>
> In Mail, touch and hold the Compose button to switch to your last saved message draft.

Could be useful on occasion, although unfortunately this does not seem to work across quitting Mail.

**Update:** Just to clarify, I don’t manually quit apps. I mean when Mail is forced to quit by the OS.
