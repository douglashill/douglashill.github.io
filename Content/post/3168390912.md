I found a brand new Mac trick!

When dragging an item in the Finder, hold down the command key when releasing and the item will snap to the grid. 

Assumptions: you are using icon view and have ‘Arrange by’ set to ‘None’ as in the screen shot below. 

What this means is that, if you use the Finder in a spacial manner, you can keep your arrangements neat as you go. I was moving some stuff around and discovered this by accident; I’m delighted.
