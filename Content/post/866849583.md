> I even have a use case for one [a Magic Trackpad] – My media center is an iMac and, due to its station on a shelf, there is just not enough travel room for a mouse.

I can’t quite picture what this setup looks like but it sparked thoughts of using a computer on a TV screen from a chair or sofa. I agree that a trackpad is better suited to this situation than a mouse as you do not need a surface to use it on. However, I can not help thinking that everything does a poor job at this compared to a Wii Remote. What we lack is a nice Wii Remote friendly interface on the Mac. I have not found a good app for this yet.
