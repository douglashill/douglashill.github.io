> SCIgen is a program that generates random Computer Science research papers, including graphs, figures, and citations. It uses a hand-written **context-free grammar** to form all elements of the papers. Our aim here is to maximize amusement, rather than coherence.

The authors of the programme gave talks based on randomly generated papers. (**Update:** the talks didn’t go very well — I don’t recommend bothering to watch the video.)
