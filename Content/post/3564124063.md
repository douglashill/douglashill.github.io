Look at what you get when editing your collections in iBooks:

<figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="700" data-orig-width="467"><img class="iphone4" src="88a6ba56fd7b5734730d0518d0da7f050311341c.png" alt="iBooks screen shot with two Done buttons on screen" data-orig-height="700" data-orig-width="467"></figure>

This is, at least to some extent, confusing. One of those identically labeled buttons should be removed, but I canâ€™t remember which without going to my iPhone and checking what each does.
