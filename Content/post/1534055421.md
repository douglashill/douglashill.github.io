> SSC Pacific has developed a technology that uses the magnetic induction properties of sodium chloride (salt) in sea water to create a VHF antenna. 

Looks very clever. It utilises the resources available. 

> An 80-foot-high stream could transmit and receive from 2 to 400 mHz with a relatively small footprint. 

Have to assume they mean MHz. It's only a factor of a billion different. 

The [PopSci article][pop] that [Kottke linked to][ko] seems to have just copied this. Maybe the factor of a billion doesn't bother some people.
