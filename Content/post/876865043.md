> Iâ€™ll have my iPhone for emergencies, but powered off to conserve its battery.

Airplane Mode conserves battery very well. I love this feature just for that. In fact, I put my iPhone in Airplane Mode every night. Power is saved but without the need for booting and shutting down. 

I have not tested leaving the iPhone unused and in Airplane Mode for as long as six days but I expect any loss of charge would be negligible. That said, maybe it would not be the best time to experiment with Airplane Mode power consumption if the iPhone is supposed to be there for emergencies.
