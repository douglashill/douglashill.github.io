Nintendo are not doing very well from a web standards point of view…  
From what I have picked up, Adobe Flash is still the most practical way to do animations on webpages. The problem here is that the big Flash item in the middle loads a static image and the others only have very simple animations. The page could easily be created with web standard technologies, which are generally better to use.
