There is nothing backwards about that. It’s a very sensible idea. 

A few years ago, I decided to design my own Harry Potter game for the then new Nintendo DS. I explored what such a game might be like by writing an extensive hands-on preview for the game. This was an immensely fun exercise, although I realised how impractical my ideas were. 

You can save a lot of time with a little imagination and by playing a game such as Amazon does to force yourself to look at something with a different perspective.
