Grumble:

I just discovered that the iTunes app doesn't play audio in the background under iOS 4 on iPhone 3G. So beyond not all features being available on weaker hardware, some features are removed compared to version three of system. 

The only podcast progressive download option available seems to be Safari. I'll take this chance to comment that Safari's audio playing capabilities are far less reliable compared to under iOS 3.
