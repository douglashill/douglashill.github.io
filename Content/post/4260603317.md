An update to [Notational Velocity][NV] came out yesterday.

The top item in the release notes caught my eye:

> “Edit With” menu for editing in WriteRoom, TextMate, etc., for all DB storage options

This makes Jesse Grosjean’s [QuickCursor][Q] redundant for me; Notational Velocity and [WriteRoom][W] now talk directly to each other. Having fewer tools makes me happier.
