[New feature in Reeder 2](http://reederapp.com/2/#/2/features/services):

> it's now possible to bring up the services panel for every link in the article

Terrific!

This will fix ‘the Daring Fireball problem’, which is when there is an item on the linked list with lots of additional commentary or other links that I want to send to Instapaper. This is missed out with the current ‘send to Instapaper’ in NetNewsWire and Reeder as DF Linked List article links in the feed point to the original article.
