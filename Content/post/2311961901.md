I found this interesting nugget on the Instapaper Blog from February 2009. Instapaper was at version 1.4 at that point. 

> Beta PDF support. I’m still not convinced that I can do this well — I can’t resize the font or provide a text-optimized layout, and there are some issues with trying to use the Read Later bookmarklet on a PDF URL. Once you get it saved, it will be just like reading a PDF in Mail or Safari, but with Instapaper’s position-saving and tilt scrolling. I guess reading PDFs without text/layout customization is better than not reading them at all.

This is from before I started using Instapaper. It’s fascinating looking back at the development of my favourite app. PDF support would mostly be redundant now we have iBooks, GoodReader and more.
