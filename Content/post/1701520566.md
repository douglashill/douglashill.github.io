[Google][g] have made some tremendous enhancements to the search results page in the last couple of weeks. 

I recently noticed the arrow on the left side of the results. What this means is keyboard navigation. This is *so* satisfying to use. Up and down on the arrow keys to go up and down, of course. Right arrow to bring up the lovely page preview, which is great for peeking when you’re not quite certain a page is what you want. Hit return to follow a result. I use this when I forget to do an ‘I’m feeling lucky’: just press return as soon as the results page loads to go to the top hit. 

I just noticed [Google Instant][gi] has ‘rolled out’ to me now. It’s really fast. Google feels like a power-tool, and yet I don’t think it is too complex to be difficult to use. They’re really good at this.
