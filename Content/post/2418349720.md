Merlin has switched to LaunchBar. As [Patrick Rhone says][MM] “if Merlin is jumping ship, Quicksilver really is dead.” I miss Quicksilver dearly, and know it’s not coming back. (I feel similarly about Leopard’s spatial Exposé.) 

Merlin taught me basically everything I know about Quicksilver. I particularly remember learning [the comma trick][CT]. 

I’ve switched to [Alfred][AL], which excels at two key parts of what Quicksilver did (launching applications, web searches) but is a much simpler and more limited tool overall.
