Jonny and Scott’s impressions on Nintendo World Report

I was intrigued by Deus Ex when it came out. I’m more likely to buy a Wii U than an Xbox 360, so maybe I’ll be able to play it. I’m getting a Resident Evil 4 feeling from this, which is my favourite Wii game, so I hope this turns out similarly.
