> Reading PDFs in your browser, instead of downloading them and reading them in an app like Preview, is a nice convenience.

I disagree. What is convenient is clicking a link to a PDF and then having it appear in a good environment for reading. 

Safari is a decent environment, but Preview would be better providing we still have one click access. 

[You can create a setup like this][1] in [Opera][2].
