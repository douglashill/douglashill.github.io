I just went looking for Google Squared, and this is what I found:

> As part of the phasing out Google Labs, Google Squared was shut down on September 5, 2011. Any saved Squares have been deleted. We will continue to use Google Squared technology to improve search, as we have already done with question answering and related searches. We hope that you have enjoyed using Google Squared as much as we enjoyed building it.

I loved Google Squared. I didn't use it much, but it was still awesome.
