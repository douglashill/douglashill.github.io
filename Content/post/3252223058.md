[The Churchill Disaster][TCD]

A display of much artistry by some of my fellows. This short film looks at the present from a possible future, and tells of a frightful disaster.

Guys, itâ€™s great!

<blockquote><p>The Churchill Disaster was directed by <a href="http://people.pwf.cam.ac.uk/rk395">Rhodri Karim</a> and filmed by Dan Miodrag, with Oisin Kearney.</p></blockquote>
