I have finished exams now. That means I can spend time going through my list of ‘things that look interesting to check out when I have time’. 

But first, I just made a Mac OS X Service to sort a list alphabetically. It’s so easy:

- Make a new Service in Automator that receives and replaces text from any application. 
- Add the action Run Shell Script and run this ‘script’: 

    sort -f

- Save the Service
- Use when necessary

You’ve just added a feature to every compliant text editor on your Mac. I love Services.

**Update:** I love Unix too.
