> The Back button should never show the text “Back”. \[…\] Note that Apple never does this, not in any app.

I [linked to][LT] this piece last month. Unfortunately I found a violation of Neven’s statement. I don’t know if anyone cares, but here it is.

When you’re adding an alarm (or editing an existing alarm) in the iPhone Clock app, the back button is labelled ‘Back’ in the Repeat, Sound and Label detail views.
