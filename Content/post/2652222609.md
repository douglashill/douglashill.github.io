I wish the iPhone App Store app would let me see apps I can't download or use. I'm sometimes using my iPhone and follow a link to an iPad appâ€™s App Store page. Information and screen shots would be far more useful than a sparse screen telling me I need an iPad to get the app. *OK, I know it's an iPad app, but I'm using my iPhone right now!*

Already, I've come across a link to an application on the Mac App Store. I want to find out more, but I can't because I'm on my iPhone.
