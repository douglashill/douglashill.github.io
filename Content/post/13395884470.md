[JotNot](http://itunes.apple.com/app/jotnot-scanner-pro/id307868751) is a fantastic iPhone application. [Dr Drang has a great post](http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2011/10/jotnot/) on it. 

The image on the right was formed from the photo on the left on the phone. The composition was created with [Acorn](http://flyingmeat.com/acorn/). 

Somehow I’ve never before noticed the magenta/green colour spot on photos taken with the iPhone 4, but it’s very clear here. Read more about it at [AnandTech](http://www.anandtech.com/show/4971/apple-iphone-4s-review-att-verizon/11).
