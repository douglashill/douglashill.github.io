So to wrap up on the [Toshiba Tablet site:][tt]

Such a shame that the page displays black text on a dark background, failing to supply an alternative to browsers without plugins

Since it’s illegible, here’s the text copied and pasted:

As [I said earlier][e], it is such a shame they don’t know the difference between the web and the Internet. 

Such a shame the page iOS devices are redirected to just shows [a big JPEG image][ima] with no text alternative. Let’s hope Toshiba pays more attention to accessibility on their tablet than they do on their website. 

Such a shame that the Toshiba Tablet site will be so lonely on my “list of interesting places” I can’t see on my iPhone. Very lonely. 

Such a shame they decided to point out a ‘weakness’ of their competitor, rather than showing me how great their tablet is. (Note: I don’t think it’s a weakness.) I’ll never see their promotional page because they’ve decided not to serve it to me. 

It is also a shame the the pure HTML mobile site that [John Gruber found][df] now returns a 403 (Forbidden).
