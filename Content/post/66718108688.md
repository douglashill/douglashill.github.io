*Resident Evil: Revelations* is available on the European and Australian Nintendo 3DS Eshop for £15 rather than £25 until this Thursday, 14 November. I passed on this one when I bought my 3DS, but replayed the demo and was very impressed. Purchased.

The game has an option to switch the 3D effect up to *very strong*. With this enabled and the lights out, *Revelations* looks better than I thought possible on the 3DS’s awful screen. It feels like peering into a room rather than looking at a flat grid of pixels.
