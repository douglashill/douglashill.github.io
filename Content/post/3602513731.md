<p><a href="http://instacastapp.com/">Instacast</a> is a new podcast listening app for iOS that is fast, elegant, and has all of the features that are missing from the functionality built into the iPod app. It is really well done. You can subscribe, download, and stream podcasts while on the go over WiFi or 3G. Browse show notes. It supports playing in the background. And the player design itself is clean. Well worth the $1.99.Â </p></blockquote>

Wow. I think Vermedio hacked into my mind and stole my ideal specification for an iPhone podcast app. My first impression is that this does *exactly* what I want, and is designed well and tastefully too. My plan is to report back in a couple of weeks (or maybe months) on how this application fits into my life.
