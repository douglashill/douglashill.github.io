Here’s something I’m looking for that would make things more pleasant sometimes: a blocker for animated GIFs for Safari. Dancing images are rather annoying when you are trying to read (or even just skim quickly). 

I don’t want to use [SafariStand](http://www.pimpmysafari.com/safaristand). A simple Safari Extension would be suitable. I don’t know what would be required to make something like this. 

Also, [Kottke recently linked][kottke] to a [piece on Slate, which celebrates animated GIFs][slate]. The [man pushing the van from in front of the train][train] is terrifying and a classic.
