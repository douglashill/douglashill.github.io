We had a terrific frost the night before I left Cambridge — which was a few weeks ago now. The ground was already whitened late in the evening. I had never seen frost like that before. 

I nearly froze my hands off taking photos in the morning — my iPhone is my camera so gloves were out of the question. Picking a best one to share here was tricky. This one is beautiful; it’s a clear example of the benefit of turning the flash on when outside in daylight.
