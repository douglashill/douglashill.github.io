The [MacBook Air][MBA] keyboard. The eject key is curious. While it can be used to eject an external [disc][disc] drive, I find it strange that a key used so infrequently would be included when software alternatives are available. 

Some speculative, alternative actions for the eject key [were discussed on Gizmodo][giz] at the time of the first generation Air. 

The eject key is also used for some power related actions, which may be useful to some people, but I never use these shortcuts. 

- Turn off display with ⇧⌃ eject
- Sleep with ⌥⌘ eject
- Restart with ⌃⌘ eject
- Shut Down with ⌃⌥⌘ eject
- Ask what to do (as pressing the power key) with ⌃ eject

I find it interesting that of these, only Sleep is shown in the menu bar. I believe this is wrong and that all actions with keyboard shortcuts should also be accessible from the menu bar. Secrets like this cause problems, because they are [hard to discover and remember][MM]. Restart and Shut Down are there, but the keyboard alternatives are not shown. This may be because the menu bar asks for confirmation, while the keyboard acts immediately.
