I only use the [Google Reader](http://reader.google.com/) web interface to check my trends once every so often. 

Here is my list of feed obscurity (subscriber numbers).

Woo! Nobody is subscribed to my own Tumblr except me. I don’t mind since I am writing for myself rather than others.

[Ars Technica Infinite Loop](http://arstechnica.com/apple/) has only one subscriber as it is a personal URL for my full text feed. ([I pay money.](http://arstechnica.com/subscriptions/index2.php))

This is interesting: [Marco Arment](http://www.marco.org/) and Lukas Mathis ([ignore the code](http://ignorethecode.net/blog/)) have the same number of subscribers to within 0.04%. I don’t know what to make of that other than it is a strange coincidence. 

As always Daring Fireball has crazy numbers of subscribers. This is just Google Reader subscribers; this does not include direct feed access, the [Twitter feed](http://twitter.com/daringfireball) and the [normal website](http://daringfireball.net/).
