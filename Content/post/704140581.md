Researching a particular topic? Try sending a Google search to Instapaper. The search results seem to come out well with Instapaper's text processor. 

Go through the results in the Instapaper iOS app and 'Read Later' all the interesting looking results. 

This is not much of a benefit if working on a computer. However, it works really well in the situation I am in now: I only have my iPhone 3G with me and I am in an area of fairly poor cellular network coverage. Instapaper mostly eliminates waiting times for pages to load and be drawn.
