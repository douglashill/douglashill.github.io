I spotted this interesting detail in the Facebook web interface:

![Screen shot from Facebook showing three buttons: “Create new list”, “Edit list” and “Delete list?”.](tumblr_l7vb7fOeUx1qb1802.png)

Why the question mark on the delete button? I can see the reasoning: it reassures you the button is not going to immediately delete the list. (A confirmation dialogue box is presented.)

The Mac interface guidelines would put an ellipsis (…) on the end of all these buttons as these all bring up a dialogue box. Not that Facebook should conform to the Mac guidelines, but I thought the question mark was curious.
