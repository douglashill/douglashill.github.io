Done. It literally took two clicks to link the accounts. 

The [Readability][R] payment system is a fantastic idea, and I really hope it works out.

To me, [Instapaper][I] and Readability look like collaborating competitors. If you link Instapaper to Readability, the two services basically do the same thing. So how do you pick which one to use for *reading*? Marco Arment addresses this concern:

> The answer is simple: use whichever one is a better fit for you. With this method, you can easily use both if you want: Instapaper for managing your reading, and Readability to contribute to publishers.

This is a non-answer to me. “Whichever one is a better fit” doesn't mean anything. You have to use Readability for contributing to publishers because that’s the only one that does it. The question is which to use for reading. 

I say the answer is Instapaper because:

- I already have it — it’s set up and familiar. 
- Instapaper is mature
    - Loads of apps can already send to Instapaper (NetNewsWire, Reeder, Twitter).
    - Email in stuff to read.
- Marco is the best. I don’t know who these Readability guys are.
