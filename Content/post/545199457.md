Marco Arment in a footnote in ‘Daring Fireball: Gizmodo and the Prototype iPhone’:

> If my iPhone isn’t in my pocket, I notice immediately. It’s a muscle memory: I instantly recognize that the sensation isn’t right.

I know this feeling.
 
Sometimes this happens: I panic momentarily realising my iPhone isn't in my pocket, then remember that *I am holding it*.
