My Mac had made a duplicate ‘me card’ containing just my name and one email address. I found this in [Mac Address Book tips: 5 more handy hints][RD] on Reality Distortion:

> ## Choosing your own card
> 
> When you first set up your Mac, Address Book creates a **“me” card** with your own contact details. However you might find that you end up with a second card which better represents you – this can happen if, for example, you import your contacts from another app or device into Address Book.
> 
> To make this second card the “me” card instead, select it and choose **Card > Make This My Card**. (You can also locate the “me” card with **Card > Go to My Card**.)

It’s simple.
