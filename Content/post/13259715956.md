<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/sep/29/bbc-hd-encryption"><img alt="screen shot of a webpage from The Guardian showing ads for Zelda Skyward Sword and iPhone 4S" src="tumblr_lv6etwxTje1qb1802.png"></a>

They know just what I want.

That said, I have no plans to buy an iPhone 4S, while Skyward Sword has been a certain purchase for about a year-and-a-half. This makes both ads somewhat pointless.
