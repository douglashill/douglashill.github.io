I caught a wasp dismembering and beheading a fly. I love the way the wing jumps towards the camera when torn off. 

- 32 seconds
- Shot with a [Canon Digital Ixus 80 IS](http://www.canon.co.uk/for_home/product_finder/cameras/digital_camera/ixus/Digital_IXUS_80_IS/)
- Quality reduced for web
- No audio (removed)
- Apologies for not setting the camera to macro focus and moving it right close. That might have disturbed the wasp.
