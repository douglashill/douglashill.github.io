<blockquote>Rachel: I've never read this book.<br />
David: It's about Colin Firth.</blockquote>

A good ploy, although I really disagree. 

My advice for P&P: read the book first (I love it) then there are a few options:

- watch the [film][f] from 2005
- if you have a lot of time, watch the [BBC television series][t] (off the top of my head, I think itâ€™s about 12 hours)
- read the [zombie version of the book][z]
