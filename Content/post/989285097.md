Interesting statistic [quoted by Charles Jade on TheAppleBlog:](http://theappleblog.com/2010/08/19/iwork-09-no-competition-for-mac-office-2011/)

> Mac Office is on about 70 percent of Macs

If true, I find this very worrying. I do not believe Office is the best tool for the job for so many people. 

(The article on TheAppleBlog is not worth reading.)
