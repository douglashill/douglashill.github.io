I’ve been playing about with CSS Media Queries. This site’s scalability is now awesome. Very narrow is quite good, although it breaks Firefox. Better use of space could be made for very wide views. I have not put any effort into optimising for iPhone, but it still works remarkably well.

Read about Media Queries: [A List Apart: Articles: Responsive Web Design](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/) (via [Thibaut Sailly](http://bureau.tsailly.net/2010/09/champagne.html))

I removed those silly diamonds for the post links (permalinks). Instead, there is an infinity symbol, ∞, which I hope will line up with the date properly at some point. **Update 1:** It lines up properly now.

I broke lists. Whoops. **Update 2:** Fixed
