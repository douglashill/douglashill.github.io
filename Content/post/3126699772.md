> What’s the real solution then?  The solution is to delegate the problem.  Turn the whole thing over to your subconscious mind.  Cut your conscious mind out of the loop.
>
> Now how do you do this?  The same way you learned any other repeatable skill.  You practice until it becomes rote.  Eventually your subconscious will take over and run the script on autopilot.
>
> This is going to sound really stupid, but it works.  Practice getting up as soon as your alarm goes off.  That’s right — practice.  But don’t do it in the morning.  Do it during the day when you’re wide awake.

What a wacky idea. It’s very forwards thinking: practice now and you’ll be better off forever. 

(I can’t remember who pointed me to this. A few days ago lots of people wrote about getting up early. For example: [Leo Babauta][1], [Chris Bowler][2], [Shawn Blanc][3] and [Nicolas Alpi][4].)
