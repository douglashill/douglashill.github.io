With iOS, the file system exists as an interface for developers and not for users. I believe that URLs should go the same way and we should accelerate this process where we can. 

There are examples of ‘normal users’ not understanding URLs, such as the ‘facebook login’ disaster on ReadWriteWeb and other sites. Generally, I think that URLs are unsightly, hard to remember, slow to type and easy to get wrong. They are just obviously unnatural. 

I am not going to go into detail now about how I avoid URLs or proposed alternative methods for users to reference resources on the web. Sorry.
