No posts for quite a long time. I have been busy and it did not help that I had no Internet connection on my Mac or iPhone. 

I am now in Germany. I’ll be working here for a few weeks this summer. 

Well, when I said no posts, there was [this one](/post/746187951). I wrote that on the flight over; I was using ‘Airplane Mode’ for its main purpose for once. Then I had no Internet connection for about eight days while things were getting set up. The result of this is that I can testify that the Instapaper app can happily hold onto a Tumblr post for a week.
