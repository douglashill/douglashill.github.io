I only noticed this in iOS 4 but it might have been there before. 

There is a back button labelled ‘Accounts’ when in the move message mode in Mail. This allows moving messages to mailboxes on other accounts. This strikes me as a very advanced feature for a pocket sized device. 

On another note, I think the explanatory text shown at the top is poorly worded. It reads “Move this message to a new mailbox.” This states a *new* mailbox, but the feature moves messages to other *existing* mailboxes, which I would not consider to be new.
