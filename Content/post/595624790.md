I used to really like the Opera browser, but it has been growing on me steadily: Opera does not work on the Mac. 

From the [Opera for desktop product page](http://www.opera.com/browser/):

> Enhanced platform integration on Windows and Mac means that Opera looks and works better than ever on your operating system.

> Along with a unified toolbar, Opera now uses the Cocoa and Core Text frameworks for improved performance and a native Mac OS look and feel.

This is what Opera looks in Snow Leopard Exposé with the Preferences window open and another dialogue spawned from that:

These are not real Mac windows! The system sees all three as one thing. 

It is all very modal: the windows below can not be interacted with while the windows closer to the front are open. Furthermore, clicking in the further back windows does not generate the system alert sound as any properly integrated application would. Moving one of the further back windows also moves all the windows in front. It’s weird. 

There are still many, many really great things about Opera. I’m posting this now as I just spotted it and thought I would vent this criticism rather than saving them up.
