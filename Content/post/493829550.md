> I’ll say this: if they ever make a bread machine with an integrated iPad dock, I’ll almost have to buy it.

I can seriously imagine this. Already, an iPhone or iPod touch can be used to control what is on a TV (with AppleTV and maybe in other ways). I think there's an app for unlocking your car.  
I don't see why these devices with lovely touch screen interfaces shouldn't be used to control all manner of other devices that currently have poor interfaces.
