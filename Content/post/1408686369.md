Reduction of the day: ceasing to use my Downloads folder. Instead, I have told Safari and Mail to save downloads to the Desktop. 

The Downloads folder is just another step that does not seem necessary; it is just sweeping the mess under the rug. 

I used to keep the Downloads folder clean and mostly empty. Since there is no mess, there is no need for the rug (Downloads folder). (Although, that’s stretching the metaphor a bit since rugs have other benefits…)
