I discovered a horrible flaw in [my desktop Trash solution](/post/1104895107). 

**When passed an alias, the script moves the original file or folder to the Trash.**

I have not found a solution to this problem yet. Aliases must be deleted via a more standard method (my favourite being ⌘⌫). I advise against using my Trash ‘Application’ for now as the risk of making a mistake with aliases is too great.
