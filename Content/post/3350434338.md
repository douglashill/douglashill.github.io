Here’s a note I made in September 2009 just after Snow Leopard came out. 

## Snow Leopard nice changes ##

- Bluetooth menu opens without delay
- `pmtool` is now `activitymonitord`
- QuickLook CSV
- Opening Inspector in Finder doesn't distract keyboard focus
- No alias on Desktop glitch after Finder relaunch
- Finder View options — setting image background uses Drag and Drop instead of mini/fake Finder

## Why am I posting this? ##

I like to look back on old notes. I add new thoughts; correct typing mistakes and file away notes that I am unlikely to need again. It’s interesting and surprising seeing my thoughts change so much. 

I still appreciate these six things fairly regularly. Because of this note, I know to thank the Snow Leopard release.
