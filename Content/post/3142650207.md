Over a year ago (in November 2009), we had the task of building robots in teams of six. This is the Engineering Part IB Integrated Design Project (IDP). Everyone who does Engineering at Cambridge should remember it. I did software (surprise!). Henry, our mechanical genius [posted this video to YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z2sxJp95u4). Thatâ€™s Henry in the video; it was my camera.

I bring this up now because we recently won the prize for best robot, of those who did the IDP at the same time (about 12 teams).

The engineering department has some (blurry) photos: [M2 2009 Robot Images](http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/DesignOffice/idp/idp_photos/2009m2/index.html). We were team 8. (Me in red.)
