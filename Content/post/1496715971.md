Yesterday was November the fifth: fireworks night! Also known as Guy Fawkes Night. [(Wikipedia)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Fawkes_Night)

I took this with with my iPhone 4 with HDR mode on. I like the tree: it adds more interest to the shot. The location is Midsummer Common, Cambridge. [(Google Maps)][1]
