> Archive Utility is used by all of us to un-zip files. The one thing I hate about it is that after you un-zip a file you need to delete the zipped file. I set the second option to delete that zipped file — which is awesome.

Excellent tip. 

Here’s another for [Alfred][a] users: add `/System/Library/Core Services` to Alfred’s Search Scope. It’s under Alfred Preferences > Features > Default Results. This means you can access Archive Utility and Software Update through Alfred. There might be some other applications in there you find useful. This does add some more junk to the results though, but this shouldn't be too much of a problem to a well trained Alfred.
