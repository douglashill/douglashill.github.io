I just tricked Expos&eacute; into letting me interact with the miniaturised windows! I could select things, scroll, do searches and more. So awesome, but I can&rsquo;t work out how to do it again.

Here is a screen shot with the top right Preview window selected:

<figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="312" data-orig-width="500"><img class="mbp" src="45f18a82d02d2ef1ba686482471ea5fae332b501.png" alt="screen shot of three windows in Expos&eacute;" data-orig-height="312" data-orig-width="500"></figure>

Then I switched to the Finder window, selected a file and did a full screen QuickLook (&#8997;-space). See how the QuickLook is *behind* the windows. Very visually appealing and atmospheric.

And all these documents are past exam papers; it&lsquo;s that time of year.
