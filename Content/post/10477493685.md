I had an existing Rich Text Format (RTF) document open in TextEdit, and it wasn't immediately obvious how to convert this to an HTML file. There is no longer a ‘Save As…’ command in Lion, and TextEdit does not have an Export command either. 

It was obvious after I worked it out: you have to duplicate the document (File > Duplicate) then, when you try to save, you can pick a format.
