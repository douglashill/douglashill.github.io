Russia building floating nuclear power stations to get oil in Arctic. My immediate simple response: why not just use power from nuclear power stations directly, rather than going via oil?

(Of course, there is probably much more energy available via the oil: “some Russian scientists claim could hold 75 billion barrels of oil”.)
