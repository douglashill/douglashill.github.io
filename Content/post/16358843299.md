I was using my Mac, and wanted to access the Spotlight preferences without taking my hands off the keyboard. I thought it would be cool if I could summon Spotlight then press *⌘-comma* but this does not work. 

The arrows keys move up and down through results, and there is a “Spotlight Preferences…” option at the bottom of every results list. I found these ways to navigate quickly:

 - Use *command* with the arrow keys to move between sections.
 - Use *control* with the arrow keys to go all the way to the top or bottom.

So I can always get to Spotlight preferences by summoning Spotlight, search for anything, press *control-down* then return. 

Alternatively, I could type ‘spotlight’ into [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) or Spotlight itself.
