Opera Mini 5 on the Google Nexus One:

It looks a bit odd having two back buttons right on top of each other.  This showcases a problem for cross-platform applications: should Opera Mini for Android look and act like Opera Mini or should it fit in with Android?  I think Opera Software tends to place more importance on cross-platform consistency than I would. However, I do only use the Mac and the iPhone so my opinion is not balanced.
