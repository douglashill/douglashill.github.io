Apple [says][A]: “iOS 4.3 is compatible with these devices:”

The iPhone 3G is finished. No more updates. It’s sad that a device which was sold as new two-and-a-half years ago is no longer being improved. On the other hand, leaving behind old hardware must contribute significantly to enabling Apple to iterate on and improve iOS so rapidly.
