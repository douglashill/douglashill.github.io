Well, this is my first shot shared with [Instagram](http://instagr.am). I decided to try out Instagram on the [recommendation of Rands](http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2010/11/12/the_art_of_not.html). While the concept of the service seemed strange to me, it does make sense now: make it really easy to make photos looks great and share them. I must say they seem to have done a superb job on making the filters great.

Let’s see if Instagram can stand the test of time.

**Update:** 9 April 2012 — today Facebook bought Instagram, and I decided to delete my account because I wasn't using the service anyway.
