Neven Mrgan: [Black Menu Bars in Lion](http://mrgan.tumblr.com/post/1426417471/black-menubar):

> A suggestion for Mac OS X Lion: since the team is trying to integrate the menubar into the desktop a bit more, to make it less prominent - the translucent menubar was an attempt at just this - why not go all the way and make it black? This way, it’ll blend into the bezel of (most) new Macs.

Looks like iPad. Looks good.
