Brett Kelly has some useful web browser tips on Bridging the Nerd Gap. Number one is “learn the keyboard shortcuts”. I agree that keyboard shortcuts can be useful, but I’m not keen on what Brett has written. 

> Anybody who knows me even a little knows that I actively dislike the mouse and studies have shown that the more you can do without taking your hand off of the keyboard, the better off you’ll be.

> I’m talking navigation whole web pages, clicking links, jumping between fields and cycling through tabs, all without ever touching the rodent.

That sounds wonderful. Appallingly, [Opera][1] is not even mentioned in the article as, in my experience, it is the only browser that effectively implements such keyboard control. Here is [Opera’s keyboard tutorial][2]. 

Opera’s most important keyboard accessibility innovations are spatial navigation of links (shift with arrow keys for two dimensional navigation), and the use of ‘find in page’ to select and follow links. I particularly like the latter. Want to log out of a site? On many sites, type “.log out” then return. The dot is equivalent to command-F. If the text found is a link, return will follow it. Powerful. 

Unfortunately, there is a critical problem that undermines this sterling work by Opera Software: most web pages are designed for the mouse. I find that it is usually easier to switch to the mouse when keyboard navigation is strained. I believe switching between keyboard and mouse is the most time consuming part of using the mouse. Fortunately, Opera has [excellent mouse shortcuts too][3]. 

#### Note

It pains me to say it, but I use Safari rather than Opera for desktop web browsing. Practically, behaving and looking like a native Mac application are more important to me than superior input methods. I believe my points about Opera’s excellence at input still stand.
