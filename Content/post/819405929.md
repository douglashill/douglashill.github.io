On looking for better tools:

> these alternate tools aren’t within arms reach when it’s time to make the biscuits. Software is the same way: sometimes we’ll use a tool that brings us nothing but pain and we know alternatives exist — we just don’t take the time to find them and make them work

Lots of examples come to mind, but there are probably more weak tools I use and have not spotted. 

Here is one example of a broken tool: [Quicksilver](http://www.blacktree.com/).

Quicksilver is technically broken. This is emotionally painful rather than irritatingly painful. For the last few weeks I have been using the beta of [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/). It does some of what Quicksilver does, but without delays or crashing or other bugs. 

An alternative to Facebook would be welcome…
