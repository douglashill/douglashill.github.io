How famous do you need to be in order to beat an everyday word at a Google search? What I’m looking for is the first page about the person or the common word. That page is almost always the Wikipedia entry. 

Note: these are all done from the UK with Google’s UK domain. This will influence some results. 

### [Brown](http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=brown)

The [university](http://www.brown.edu/) takes the top spot, while the [colour’s Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown) beats that of the university. Our former Prime Minister takes fourth spot; he isn’t famous enough. 

### [Thatcher](http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=thatcher)

The former Prime Minister is the clear winner. The profession isn’t very commonly referred to: it isn’t a common enough word, so maybe I shouldn’t have included this. 

### [Bush](http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=bush)

The band actually wins against the former US presidents. The type of woody plant is nowhere to be seen. 

### [Jobs](http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=jobs)

The great man is utterly swamped by the search for positions of regular employment. How cruel. 

### [Gates](http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=gates)

Well this is an interesting one. For me, most of the first page was taken up by ads, a news result and Twitter. When I finally arrived at the standard results, I found companies selling wooden gates took first, second and third places. Fourth is a car dealer, then finally at fifth place we have William Henry Gates III. 

### [Bell](http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=bell)

Insurance, followed by the [Wikipedia disambiguation page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell), and then Alexander Graham Bell. 

### [King](http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=king)

A games website, King’s College London, the chess piece, Martin Luther King, Steven King and King’s College Cambridge. Wikipedia deals with male monarchs on [a page titled ‘Monarch’](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King) rather than a specific page for kings. Probably due of this, there is nothing about monarchs on the first page of Google results. 

### [Cook](http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=cook)

Frozen food just beats James Cook for the top spot. The plain form of cook does not do very well, but ‘[cooking][c]’ fairs better: the [Wikipedia page on cooking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooking) is there, but it’s still one behind Jamie Oliver.

### So who is the winner?

I don’t think that even makes sense. You could say Baroness Thatcher, but I think ‘thatcher’ is hardly ‘everyday’ enough to count. My vote goes to James Cook for being so close to the top for a very common word.
