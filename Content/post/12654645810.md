This morning we had a guest speaker in our [4F12 Computer Vision][S] lecture: [Matt Brown][MB], who’s behind [AutoStitch for iPhone][AS], gave a great talk on panoramic photo stitching. It tied in very well with our lectures. I love being reminded that there are sometimes useful applications of stuff we learn in University, and occasionally it’s even profitable. 

I use AutoStitch iPhone for stitching photos; it does a fantastic job. I actually send photos from my Mac to my iPhone for stitching, because I haven't found anything on the Mac that works. I recently heard about [Autopano Pro][APP], which licences the AutoStitch technology so I intent to try it out.
