> Very nice, and that’s what I’m going to try. This way I’ll see the downloads folder and be able to search easily when processing. As a bonus, my desktop remains uncluttered.

I'm pretty sure that this is how a new Mac comes. I use the Desktop (as I [said in October][O]), because I don't use the Dock so I would forget about things in the Downloads folder.
