This follows on from my [previous post](/post/491544156).  
I really like Lukas Mathisâ€™ idea to show the adjacent iPad home screens when rotating to landscape. Perhaps I like it so much because I had the same idea myself. A while ago, I devised a *concept* for a very simple looking iPhone feed reader.  

#### Mockups

#### How it works

- Synchronises with Google Reader
- All feeds are put together
- The content fills the screen, one story at a time
- Swipe to go between stories, like the cards in the iPhone Weather App
- Older items are to the left, newer to the right
- Saves position on quit
- Tapping links goes to Safari
- Settings in the Settings App
- Pull down or tap on the top right corner of an article to see options like Instapaper, starring and sharing
