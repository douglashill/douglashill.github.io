So I was trying to create a [Steam][S] account, but I couldn’t do the captcha thing to ‘verify my humanity’. I tried three times and it said I didn't enter the characters correctly. Madness. 

**Update:** I think it’s just that their servers are having problems. Maybe there are too many people trying to sign up to download Portal for free.
