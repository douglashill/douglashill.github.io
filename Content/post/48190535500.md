Since I started at [Zolmo](http://zolmo.com) in October, I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of my time working on [Touchfit: Georges St-Pierre][TF], which we released on Appleâ€™s app store yesterday.

I&rsquo;m so happy with how the application turned out. The user interface is both familiar and exotic; you have to see it in motion. [Watch the trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_Yn0kEifk) and [download now for iPhone and iPod Touch][TF].
