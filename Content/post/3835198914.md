FaceTime was a great name when it came out with the [iPhone 4][4]. It was really all about seeing *faces*.

With the new [MacBook Pros][MBP] and the [iPad 2][iPad], FaceTime shows more than just faces. Nevertheless, it’s still a catchy name.

I find video conversations such as FaceTime lacking in ‘connectedness’ — certainly when done on a computer. I haven’t had the chance to do an iPhone to iPhone call, so maybe that’s better. The iPad 2 looks like it could be really great: combining a large screen, for peripheral vision, with the *intimacy* and focus of iOS. The iPad will need to be propped at just the right height and angle though. 

Time will tell if this can really become commonplace, as audio calls are today.
