Well that was very fast. 

I really didn't want to publish what I wrote about the Instapaper 3.0 update, and now I don’t have to. I wrote about visual clutter, advertisements, task-centric user interfaces, information hierarchies, unbalanced trees and the modular nature of great software. It was all about Instapaper’s new ‘Browse Bar’. 

With the Browse Bar hidden, I can forget about the features added in 3.0 that I found objectionable. Instapaper is fully great again.
