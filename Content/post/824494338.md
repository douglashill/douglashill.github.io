[Nokia statement via Engadget:](http://www.engadget.com/2010/07/16/nokia-we-prioritize-antenna-performance-over-physical-design-i/)

> we prioritize antenna performance over physical design if they are ever in conflict

Does this statement confuse physical design — an immensely broad term — with appearance?

John Gruber seems to think so, based on [his comment:](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/07/17/nokia)

> Judging by how their phones look, must be a lot of conflicts.

The iPhone 4’s external aerial not about looks. It provides many technical advantages, some of which [Gruber listed earlier:](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/07/17/siracusa)

> better signal quality overall, better aesthetics, more structural rigidity, even better battery life because there’s room for a bigger battery without an internal antenna

As I see it, the external aerial is there to provide these technical advantages but at the *cost* of appearance: all other factors aside, I believe most people would say the device would look better without the black lines in the steel frame.
