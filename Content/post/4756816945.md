by Ben Brooks on The Brooks Review

An unusual critique of [Tweetbot][T] by Ben. He seems fixated on *features*, and I thought this whole Apple thing was about more than that.

I feel the whole piece is dodges the key point that Ben simply disagrees with those who love Tweetbotâ€™s user experience.
