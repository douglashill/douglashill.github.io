I had a zombie podcast episode in [Instacast](http://vemedio.com/products/instacast). It was cached and refused to be cleared. 

The solution:

- Turn on iCloud sync
- Delete Instacast from the device
- Download the app again
- Choose to use iCloud sync when asked

The downside was that I had to go through Instacast’s settings; these are not synced, and many of the defaults are not to my liking (such as auto-caching). 

Also, Instacast’s iCloud sync has no feedback. If you're unsure whether the sync has worked, create a backup of your subscription list by emailing it out.
