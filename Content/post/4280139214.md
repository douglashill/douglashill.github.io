I am in awe of Hugh Sissling&rsquo;s iPad home screen, which he posted at Woooster:

<figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="667" data-orig-width="500"><img class="iPad" src="c8b5d37d8ca47f967561d0c938f3a42615cee3bf.jpg" alt="iPad home screen screen shot with application icons only in the dock" data-orig-height="667" data-orig-width="500"></figure>

> I opted for no apps or folders on the homescreen at all.

Such focus is impressive. Sissling knows what he uses his iPad for.

Also, this layout completely abolishes the problem of the iPad home screen icons moving around when the device is rotated. (See [iPad Springboard Breaks Spatiality][LKM] by Lukas Mathis.)
