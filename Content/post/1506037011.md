See this video of a fast running goal keeper. ([YouTube link][yt])

[Jason Kottke describes it well:][jk]

> He's moving so comically fast compared to the other players on the pitch that it reminds me of the not-so-special effect of Clark Kent [racing the train][sm] in Superman.

If all football was like this, I’d watch it a lot. (I don’t watch it at all.)
