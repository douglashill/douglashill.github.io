From [Ars Technica:](http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2010/12/iphone-jailbreaker-set-to-bring-cydia-to-mac-os-x.ars)

> For instance, users that have jailbroken iPhones would like to have a modified version of iTunes that does not ask to update iOS when the device is plugged in, since the update might overwrite jailbreak modifications," Freeman said.

Try these:

- iTunes > Preferences > General > Check for new software updates automatically — OFF
- iTunes > Preferences > Devices > Prevent iPods, iPhones, and iPads from syncing automatically — ON

No system hack necessary.

**Another thought:** We don’t normally include the serial comma in British English (the one before the ‘and’ in the second path above). Should localisation take conventions such as this into account?
