> …users should not place themselves at the mercy of Apple or H.264 either. If you buy an iPhone OS computer, there is no recourse if Apple makes a decision you do not like. 
…you’ll wait on Apple to implement any bug fixes or new features, or to take care of your security—even though it’s ostensibly *your* platform, *your* computer, and part of *your* life.

I am happy to be at the mercy of Apple. I am very grateful for the new features coming in iPhone OS 4 and that Apple is taking care of keeping my iPhone secure. It is a good thing they can take care of the bugs too because I would not have any idea how to fix iPhone OS bugs. (Also, the phrase “iPhone OS computer” amuses me.)

> A free Web needs free software. 

I am not too bothered about a free web by that definition. 

> Fortunately, the way out of the Adobe vs. Apple cage match is straightforward, and exists already: free software operating systems like GNU/Linux

This just makes me laugh.
