Downloading from iTunes is how I’ll be watching tomorrow’s show. I used [Apple’s Events page][AE] [last time][LT], which streams the movie. The benefit of downloading is that I can see exactly how much network traffic I am going to use. Also, I can watch parts again without using requiring more network access. These are useful things when your network use is capped. 

**Update:** it’s up first on the Events page, so I’m going there.
