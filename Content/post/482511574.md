Here is another idea: in day view show today on the left and tomorrow on the right with a month grid to show you where you are in the month. This view is not for looking at any day you like: only today and tomorrow. A decent view of what is happening on future days is available in week view.  
I like this view better than the mix up view I made earlier. Switching views is not a problem. Rather than trying to cram everything into one logarithmic view, I think it would be better to have this day view for the immediate future and week or month views for getting an overview of the more distant future.  
I think this would work for me. I regularly check what is happening for the rest of today and tomorrow morning using day view on my iPhone.  
I have a feeling all these ideas will have occurred to Appleâ€™s designers, but were rejected. What have they found out that I do not know?
