[ignore the code: Saving Documents by Proxy](http://ignorethecode.net/blog/2010/12/05/saving_documents_by_proxy/)

Lukas Mathis discusses the benefits of saving files by dragging to a destination already on screen. Worth a look.

I mocked up this this idea about a month ago:

![Mocked up screen shot of a large icon in the Mac OS X menu bar under File > Export](tumblr_lcyv75wjz41qb1802.png)

Itâ€™s a static image; there is no working code. The principle is that you drag an icon out of the menu bar to a folder that is already open. Lukas points out that the destination could even be an FTP application.
