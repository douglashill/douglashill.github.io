#### Exciting stuff!

In the dark ages I used Internet Explorer 6 on Windows XP. Then about four years ago, I tried Opera 9 and found it much better than Internet Explorer. Two years later, one of the first things I did on my shiny new MacBook Pro was download Opera. Recently, I have spent six weeks using Safari and two weeks so far with Camino.  

#### Why am I posting this?

This is some background information. I hope to write about what I think about each of these browsers at a later date. I have also have thoughts regarding the overall state of web browsers, which I would like to share.
