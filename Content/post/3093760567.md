I added this CSS rule to my stylesheet:

    ol ol, ol ul, ul ol, ul ul {
        padding-left: 2.618em;
    }

This is fun to read out loud. 

The rule is for indenting lists with multiple levels. (I set lists to have no padding so list text is flush with other body text and the bullets or numbers hang in the margin. I want indents for sub-lists, though.)
