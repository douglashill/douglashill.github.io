I just saw this issue on Notational Velocity’s GitHub page: [Never unmounts hidden RAM disk when closing Notational Velocity][1]. 

It seems the RAM disk can not be unmounted, and causes shutdown to take a long time. This explains why my Mac took about a minute to shut down (compare to booting, which takes thirty seconds).

Scrod points out that this security feature can be disabled by setting the User Defaults key `UseInsecureTempEditing ` (boolean) to true. 

I did this and a single test showed my Mac shutting down in twenty seconds: three times faster. (This is still longer than I think it ought to take — I remember Snow Leopard as being faster.)
