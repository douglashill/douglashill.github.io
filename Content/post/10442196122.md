I mindfully keep my usage of Safari lightweight (no tabs; close things when I’ve finished; offload to Instapaper), and haven't seen any general performance problems in Safari 5.1. 

I have often seen big delays when starting ‘Find…’. It annoying, but doesn’t bother me enough to go looking for alternatives.
