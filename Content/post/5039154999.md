I bought this big box of [Kellogg’s Crunchy Nut][KCN], but it was too tall to fit on my shelf. So I cut the top off, ensuring all the cereal still fits within the bounds of the box. This really highlighted how redundantly large the box is. 

I reduced the height from about 330 mm to 240 mm: making the box just *three-quarters* of its original size. 

Lorries are driving around carrying cereal boxes that are *a quarter filled with air*. Terrible. 

(Obviously there’s way more air in the box than that, but you wouldn’t want to crush the cereals to dust.)
