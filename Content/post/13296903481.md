Speaking of Skyward Sword, I liked Neal’s review. The text is fine on its own, but the video review is worth scrolling down to.

I’ve not seen a video review done like this before. It’s a narration of the article, with bits from the game that demonstrate or complement what’s being talked about. It’s exquisite, and really makes me excited about the game.
