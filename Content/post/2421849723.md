Here is an inconsistency in the iOS Settings app on iPhone.

When airplane mode is turned on, the row in the list for ‘Carrier’ is removed, shifting everything below upwards.

In contrast, when airplane mode is turned on, the row for ‘Phone’ settings stays visible but is disabled by being greyed out. A clear label reads ‘Airplane Mode’.

The problem here is the lack of consistency. I see no reason for these two items in the same list to respond differently to the same change. If both are not available when the cellular network aerials are turned off, then both should be disabled in the same way.

I suggest that the behaviour of ‘Phone’ is better. It is more stable and is very clear about what is going on. I often want to tap an item (such as ‘Brightness’) after toggling airplane mode, but I struggle because the target moves. This is where stability is key.

As a counter to this, it may match the rest of the OS more to use the behaviour of ‘Carrier’. For example, when Wi-Fi is turned off, the option to ‘Ask to Join Networks’ is removed, not just greyed out.
