Find out more on [this post on the Daring Fireball Linked List last April](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/04/05/ipad-optimized-iphone-os-reference-library), go to the top level of the [Reference Library](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/navigation/index.html) or the [Accessibility Programming Guide](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/iPhoneAccessibility/Introduction/Introduction.html).
