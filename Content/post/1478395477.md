Oh, no!

The iPhone Camera app does not use task completion when saving high dynamic range photographs. If you leave the app while it is saving, the HDR is lost. (Although the regular, non-HDR photo will be saved if enabled in Settings.)

What a shame.

(This isn’t supposed to be totally serious. I’m sure I’ll get by with what I have and be thankful for it.)
