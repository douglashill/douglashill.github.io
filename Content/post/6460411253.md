I was trying to work out how to use AppleScript to open a URL in the default web browser on Mac OS X. Web searches returned multi-line scripts that only work with Safari. I came up with this:

    do shell script " open 'https://douglashill.co/' "

Far easier, and more flexible, than specifically commanding Safari.
