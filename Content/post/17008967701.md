> It seems unlikely that you are going to care very deeply about these changes, and if you do, you can easily get the older version of the utility.

I'm super annoyed and losing sleep over this. It’s 3am and I’m [downloading software](/post/17006909281) and reading articles. Why?

> Still, though, I think it’s both peculiar and curious that Apple is requiring users to choose between a nicer UI and access to the full feature set of their AirPort devices.

The new interface isn't nicer, it's silly. Basically all of the application’s functionality is presented in a sheet!
