Martin Hering on the Vemedio Blog:

> After the tremendous success of Instacast for the iPhone, a lot of customers asked me about a version for the iPad. At first I thought nay, who takes his iPad on the way to listen to podcasts when an iPhone in your pocket is so much more convenient? Then the idea grew on me. I thought about for what somebody would actually prefer to use the iPad. Whatâ€™s great about the iPad is its big screen and the comfort you have browsing the internet, reading books or articles and watching movies on it. So I focused on exactly these three point: Big honking fullscreen video, comfortable to read show notes and incredible web integration.

He gets it.
