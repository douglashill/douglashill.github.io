I’ve been using iPhoto for almost three years, but I recently found something new!

I knew you could use the compare button in full screen to view two photos at once. The other day, I found that if you select multiple photos then go to full screen, iPhoto shows all the selected photos together. Up to eight can be compared at a time. Photographs can be removed from the view one at a time; this is great for whittling down to just the best. 

Note: I’m still using iPhoto ’08 (and hoping to upgrade). This might work differently in iPhoto ’11.
