It occurred to me that many of Apple’s key changes with Lion could just be changes in the [human interface guidelines][HIG] rather than system level technical changes. 

Here are the six key Lion features, from around fifty-six minutes into the [Back to the Mac event][E]:

I am very much looking forward to automatic saving and state preservation. This is a big part of why I love [Notational Velocity][n] so much. In particular, I’m looking forwards to this in Pages and Safari. (Extensions like [SafariRestore][x] shouldn't be necessary for this.)
