I am very interested in seeing how Google TV turns out. I commend Google for having a go at improving how we use technology in the living room. What's below is about something I find puzzling about their strategy. I am not trying to say 'Google sucks'. 

Remember the day before Google TV was announced? WebM was the big announcement in the keynote of the first day of Google IO. Now there's this:

> Google TV is capable of playing 720p and 1080p Flash videos. For best performance:
> 
> Use h.264 encoding for all video content. Avoid encoding your videos in h.263 or vp6.

No mention of WebM or the HTML video tag. 

I know this section is about Flash, not video in general, but a mention of WebM would seem relevant here. I thought 'open' video was the future.
