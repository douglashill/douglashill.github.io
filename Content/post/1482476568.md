> Then again, people complained about Command-N changing from making a new folder in OS 9 to making a new Finder window in OS X and look where that got them.

The Macalope is a funny read once in a while. 

I wouldn't mind command-N for new folders. I've never used Mac OS 9 (I'd like to try it) but I'm a full subscriber to the spatial Finder way of doing things. 

(The relation between what command-N does to the spatial Finder might not be obvious: when working spatially, thereâ€™s no concept of a new window so command-N is currently wasted.)
