Steve Jobs’ opinion comes across very clearly. He's honest and direct. This is commendable. 

It is also interesting how little new we learn from this interview. I think Jobs’ opinion and vision come across in the products themselves. 

My favourite bit is the comment that PCs are like trucks. This makes a lot of sense to me.
