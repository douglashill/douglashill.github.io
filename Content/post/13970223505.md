A nice update to one of my favourite apps. I love the new option to use ‘@done’ for completed items. Contrary to the release notes, this works well with the standard [Notational Velocity](http://notational.net/), not just [nvALT](http://brettterpstra.com/project/nvalt/).

One downside: despite claims that syncing is now faster, I see the network activity indicator in the status bar keep spinning for ages (about a minute or two each time).
