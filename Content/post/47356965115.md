![Time Machine menu bar icon](tumblr_inline_mkvt1xR39V1qz4rgp.png)

The Time Machine menu bar icon does not spin when preparing backups on Mountain Lion. It now spins only when copying, providing less feedback. I don’t like this.

If I had a Mac that supported Power Nap (continues backing up after being put to sleep) and was convinced the backups reliably completed, then I would remove the icon from the menu bar and forget about it. But I don’t, so I want to babysit the backups.
