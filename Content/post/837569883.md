<blockquote><p>When was the last time you checked out your Utilities folder? Well, if you answer was "What's that?" then let me explain. Inside of your Applications folder is another folder called Utilities that is filled with a sorts of wondrous things that most people either don't know or completely forget is there. Even veteran Mac users are guilty of this. I know I am.</p></blockquote>

I know about my Utilties folder. I know its store of spatial data is corrupt as it often reverts to a messed up arrangement of the icons. Iâ€™ve tried deleting the .DS_Store file but have had no results. 

The Utilities folder is a good place to put third party utility apps. Obvious when you think about it. A few I have put there are [Facebook URL Helper](http://releasecandidateone.com/projects/fb-url), [Key Codes](http://manytricks.com/keycodes/) and [Tumblr Backup](http://staff.tumblr.com/post/286303145/tumblr-backup-mac-beta).
