With [all this brouhaha about Bing copying Google][B], I thought I&rsquo;d share what was keeping me on Google.

**Google&rsquo;s awesome keyboard navigation.**

Keyboard navigation is a recent addition to Google, and [I said how much I loved it][C] back in November. This is something I &lsquo;can't live without&rsquo;. Until I looked just now, that feature was what was preventing me from trying an alternative. To my immense excitement, I have found that [DuckDuckGo][D] works the same! Up, down and return do what I expect. So I&rsquo;ve toggled a setting in [Alfred][A]. (PowerPack required.)

Keyboard navigation isn't a consideration on the iPhone. I just switched Safari to use Bing as an experiment. I plan on reporting back on how both these changes work out.
