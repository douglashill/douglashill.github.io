by Dr Drang on All this

> It seems like every Mac-related site I visit or subscribe to is spending more time telling my how much money Apple is making and less time telling me how I can make better use of my Macs and iPhone. A little cheerleading is fine, but I don’t need to see daily stories about how Apple is dominating this sector or that. The smartphone marketshare battle with Android, for instance, has absolutely no effect on how I use my iPhone or how I live my life.

I concur.

*All this* is great, because it's almost entirely made up of nerdy workflows and observations. Dr Drang’s interests, like mine, are focused on products and engineering, not boring business topics.
