> The demo seemed targeted specifically to existing FarmVille players, because I (having never played the game) couldnâ€™t make heads or tails out of how one is supposed to play or what sort of entertainment it was supposed to provide.

Would it be overly cynical of me to say that Farmville exists more to make Zynga money than to provide entertainment?
