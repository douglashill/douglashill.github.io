> Mail rules help you reduce inbox clutter by automatically filing messages into folders you select ahead of time. Set them up at me.com, and your rules organize your incoming email on the web and everywhere else â€” on your iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Mac, and PC.

I'm not sure why editing rules that run on the server should be restricted to the web interface. Hopefully these settings shall be integrated into the native software in the future. 

I do not use Mobile Me, but it would be lovely if a standard emerged for setting up email server rules outside of a web interface. Something that would let me set up Google Mail rules from the iPhone Settings.

(This is all wishful thinking. I haven't seen any signs that anyone has an interest in implementing this.)
