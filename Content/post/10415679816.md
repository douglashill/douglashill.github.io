I just found this old, but excellent, trick.

If there is a URL on the clipboard, and you use [Notational Velocity][NV]’s ‘Paste as New Note’ command (⇧⌘V), “it will actually download all of the text of the page the link leads to, title it and insert the original url at the beginning”.

[NV]: http://notational.net/

In the comments, Zachary Schneirov (Scrod, creator of Notational Velocity) adds:

> You can also just drag the URL icon directly into the notes list.
