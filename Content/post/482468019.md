I’ve been thinking about the iPad’s calendar and the idea of making the near future more important than the far future.  
In week view make the column for today wider and use this to show a little more information?

I would like continuous scrolling as well. This is the opposite of reading, where I find pagination works better. With this design, whenever I open the calendar *today* is on the far left and the next six days are to the right (whether weekdays or weekends). Horizontal and vertical scrolling should be strictly locked in: no diagonal scrolling.  The bar at the bottom acts as a scroll guide so you know where you are. (Movement of the scroll bar not show in the image.) Oh, I don’t know if this continuous scrolling is already on the iPad. It could be, but it does not like it to me from what I have seen.
