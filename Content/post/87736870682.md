[Apple has a lot of new developer stuff for us this week.](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/) Some miscellaneous early thoughts on their new programming language, [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/):

- A couple of months ago, I wanted something with [Soulver][S]’s persistent answers column and also the power of a full programming language, like [Matlab][M]. (But please not Excel.) Playgrounds are it.
- Playing around, I find I can do
   
        10.intValue
   
   but not
   
        let ten = 10
        ten.intValue
  
   because *'Int' does not have a member named 'intValue'*. And then I can not do
  
        pow(ten, 2)
  
  because *'NSNumber' is not a subtype of 'CDouble'*. I don’t know what `10` is: `Int` or `NSNumber`?
- It seems there’s so much new stuff to learn I might as well switch to Android development.
