From the App Store Review Guidelines:

> 10.4 Apps that create alternate desktop/home screen environments or simulate multi-app widget experiences will be rejected

Does this mean Facebook should be rejected for the way the top level of its navigation mimics the iOS home screen? (Grid arrangement on multiple screens, hold to enter ‘jiggle mode’ to move.) For me, this interface works very poorly. I often press the home button and quit the app by accident, when I just want to go to the top level of the Facebook app or stop rearranging the icons. 

A simple list would be a fine alternative. 

(I’m pretty sure Facebook will not be rejected for this, but I’d like it to be.)
