No idea how I found it, but I really enjoyed reading this reflection on one of my favourite modern games. Jennifer does a great job explaining how the game is great. I call Resident Evil 4 a modern game because I played it on Wii, which is current. (It’s competing with Super Mario Galaxy for the title of favourite.)

I feel the game has added value on Wii because of the splendid controls. Despite being ‘unrealistic’, the limitation of not being able to move and shoot at the same time makes the Wii controls work *really well*. Far better than full first-person shooters have on Wii (Conduit and Goldeneye). Resident Evil 4 Wii lets you shoot insanely accurately, and it feels awesome. I used the Broken Butterfly (a very powerful .45 magnum revolver) as if it was a long-range rifle. Really great.
