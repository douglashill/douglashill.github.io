In Safari for Mac, ‘Open Location…’ (type a URL) is in the File menu:

Making a Google search is under Edit > Find:

I think this is not ideal. These two actions are very similar: both focus a text field in the toolbar used for going to websites. I suggest that they should be next to each other in the File menu. Making a Google search happens at the web page (file) level. The Edit menu is usually used for things happening within a file such as with the text content of a file. 

Some would say this is increasingly irrelevant with the advent of the iPad. In fact, this is my opinion. However, this does not mean Mac application interface design is unimportant: just less than it used to be.
