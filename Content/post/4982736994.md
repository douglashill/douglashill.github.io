BBC News:

> Sales of tablet PCs have been booming globally, led by the success of Apple’s iPad.

This must be frustrating for Apple. Both that their beautiful iPad is referred to as a “PC” and that, as Marco Arment says,  ‘[There really isn’t much of a “tablet” market][M]’. It's basically just the iPad.

The whole article is a bit ridiculous.
