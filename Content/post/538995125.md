Marco Arment again:

> Make a “Watch Later” folder on Instapaper and save this there if you don’t have 10 minutes to watch it now.

Cool, Marco recommends using the system I've been using for a while now. As well as Read Later, I have added View Later (for difficult layouts), Watch Later, Listen Later and Act On Later (not for important tasks — mostly applications to download and try).

I watched some of Put This On. Kind of crazy. I tie my shoe laces in a strange way that might or might not be similar to the recommended method. 

At the credits, I wanted to go back up and immediately tried scrolling with a vertical swipe (watching on my iPhone). Obviously you need to scrub the video progress bar. 

I think what I tried to do was reasonable. I very much like the idea of interactive credits. Scroll around, tap a name to see a photo and more information. This is something where new technologies like the web can improve on cinema and TV.
