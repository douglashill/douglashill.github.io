I made a smoothie. Smoothies are delicious and healthy, although time-consuming to make. 

#### Ingredients

- ring of pineapple about 20 mm thick
- two thirds of a banana
- some Tropicana orange juice (maybe about 200 ml)

Blended until smooth, this made about 400 ml which was slightly too much for this glass. 

This is close to as simple as a smoothie can get. The taste is good though so I recommend this recipe. Don’t add too much banana or it dominates, and try to avoid blending pineapple seeds as they’re very bitter.
