Search is fundamental to the web. Safari already integrates *making* a Google Search. I wonder how it would work out if a web browsing app integrated the *results* as well.

I thought of this while looking at [Making of NetNewsWire/iPad: UI Walkthrough](http://netnewswireapp.com/2010/04/making-of-netnewswireipad-ui-walkthrough/). I stole images from the mockups and replaced the list of feed contents with Google search results. 

First, a split view in landscape:

And a popover in portrait:

I am afraid that [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/), the sample search I have shown, is not a good example as this idea would not be very useful for when you know exactly what you are looking for and are using Google to acquire it. This idea is for when you do not know what you are looking for and are researching a particular topic.
