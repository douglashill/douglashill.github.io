(I warn that this piece somewhat resembles a rant.)

[BT][B] tacks on bits-and-pieces onto their phone and internet connection packages to make it harder to find the things you care about (the phone and internet connection).

[They say][TS]:

> We've teamed up with leading online security company McAfee to offer BT NetProtect Plus.

My belief is that you don’t need this junk on your Mac. 

Following a hunch, I did a search and was redirected to [this][FT]:

> Unfortunately BT NetProtect Plus is not currently compatible with Apple Macs.

There is a lot I dislike here: the unwanted add-ons; the pictures not fitting in with the words; and the poor use of terminology. I would agree that the software ‘does not run on Mac OS X’, but that’s not what they say. They could show a picture of a MacBook Pro running Windows, which could run the security software even though it is still an “Apple Mac”.
