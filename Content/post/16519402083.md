I’m not the only one thinking about the lacking support for mathematical expressions in iBooks Author. It works with MathType (as does Pages ’09), but this isn’t enough.

iBooks could do more than just display expressions. I’d find it very useful to be able to get more information about symbols: what is it defined as and where else is it used?

Maybe mathematical expressions could be another built-in widget type in a future version of Author.
