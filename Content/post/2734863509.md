I made a new theme today, which I’m trying out now. It’s still not finished, although all the key aspects are in place. My inspiration was seeing the [One Thing Well mobile site][OTW] in a desktop browser. 

[OTW]: http://onethingwell.org/mobile/post/1406530056

I did not intend to use this design for this site, but I really liked how it turned out. I still might switch back, but there is a lot of value to me in that I’ve made this theme from scratch, rather than by hacking away at someone else’s. 

**Update 1:** Oh dear, the post links (infinities) are broken in everything except Safari. That’s something for the morning. 

**Update 2:** Fixed
