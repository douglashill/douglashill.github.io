iPhone and iPad applications that run on iOS 6 and iOS 7 now make use of the app icon in fourteen sizes. Ideally each would be individually pixel tweaked to perfection. However, that is not always practical, so I [wrote](https://gist.github.com/douglashill/6563622) a little [JSTalk](http://jstalk.org/) script to save time. Requires [Acorn](http://www.flyingmeat.com/acorn/).
