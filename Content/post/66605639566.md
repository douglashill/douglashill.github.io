The text appears too slowly, and makes an annoying sound. 

An interactive, visual novel with a poor reading experience is akin to a platformer with poor physics. 

**Update:** You can press B to skip text. (Thanks [spookyt-reecer6](http://spookyt-reecer6.tumblr.com/post/66629958102/phoenix-wright-ace-attorney-dual-destinies-first) — I’ve never player an Ace Attorney game before.) But why not just A? And does anyone like text appearing slowly? And why do text heavy games still only show two lines at once when there’s plenty of space of the 3DS’s two screens?
