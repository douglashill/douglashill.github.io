Fundamental mistake: I just tried to use an equals sign to set a variable in AppleScript. 

Use words, not symbols. 

My script is for taking some text and wrapping it in quotation marks.

Here is the script:

	on run {input, parameters}
		set input to "“" & input & "”"
		return input
	end run

Nothing difficult for today. I have set this as a Mac OS X Service receiving and replacing text from any application.
