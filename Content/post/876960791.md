Hooray: YouTube videos straight out of articles in Instapaper. I don't know if this is deliberate, but it is a grand success for the Instapaper HTML parser. 

The [article is from Tested and about Microsoft Research's Street Slide](http://www.tested.com/news/microsoft-researchs-vision-of-street-slide-is-awesome/612/) and I found it via [Lukas Mathis on Ignore the Code](http://ignorethecode.net/blog/2010/07/29/street_slide/).
