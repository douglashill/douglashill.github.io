[Nancie Wight](http://njwight.tumblr.com/post/3333484291/oilnwater):

> What to shoot? It&#8217;s too cold. Too much snow. Slush everywhere. No animals. (Ok-squirrels and crows) So, time to experiment. I suspended a glass casserole dish over two tall beer glasses. Put some water in it. Dropped in some vegetable oil. Slid a plate under the glass dish with coloured crystals and rocks from Sedona. Attached my 100M macro and shot.

Nancie has a series of oil and water photos, but I think the first — this one — is the best. It’s so perfect. Looks like a sci-fi interpretation of space. Maybe this is physics in visual form.
