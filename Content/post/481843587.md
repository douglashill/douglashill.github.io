More on [Marco Arment’s Logarithmic calendar view](http://www.marco.org/480805355). Also see my [previous post](/post/481778917).

I spent too much time making this crude mockup. No, it isn't lined up properly and, no, it doesn’t make sense because the dates do not all match up and that birthday is not really where the pictures say it is. This is not important for now.

The general idea is:

* Today and tomorrow on the left in iPhone style day view. I pinched the idea of compressing free time from Palm’s WebOS — this is not fundamental to the idea.
* Future on the right in iPhone style list view. I’m trying to show only the one main event for each of the next few days and then the main events of the next couple of weeks in the lower right.

The iPad’s Calendar application is a good start as it has a split view. From what I can tell, it shows the same information twice in day view, which is rather puzzling.
