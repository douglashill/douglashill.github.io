I’ll be away, but London people we have an [NSLondon pub evening this coming Thursday 29th](https://www.meetup.com/nslondon/events/313003731/) on Chancery Lane. This is in coordination with the organisers of the [SwiftCraft conference in Folkestone in May](https://swiftcraft.uk/), which had great speakers last year and is in a lovely venue by the sea.
