Great evening at [Engineering Kiosk Alps](https://engineeringkiosk.dev/meetup/alps/) hosted by [Cloudflight](https://www.cloudflight.io/). Similar format to [NSLondon](https://nslondon.com/). Talks:

- Anna Larch: [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) is good place to work. Like [Nutrient](https://www.nutrient.io/): ~160 people, remote, high trust, no fixed hours.
- [Beate Öttl](https://www.studio-craft.at/): Still good to avoid building the wrong thing fast.
