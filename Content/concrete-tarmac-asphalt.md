*[Concrete][]* is any material composed of a mineral *[aggregate][]* bound by a *binder*. *[Cement][]* is a powder that, when mixed with water, gives a binder. In everyday use, concrete usually refers to *Portland cement concrete*, which uses *[Portland cement][]*.

Our use of the word *[tarmac][]* referring to road surfaces is historical. Tarmac was popular for surfacing roads about a century ago. Almost all road surfaces have been replaced by *[asphalt concrete][]*, which is often just called asphalt in everyday use. Technically, *[asphalt][]* refers to the binder used in asphalt concrete. Asphalt is also known at *bitumen*, and is a viscous liquid present in most [crude oil][].
