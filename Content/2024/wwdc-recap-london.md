Just [found out from Dave Verwer](https://mastodon.social/@daveverwer/112653390904712676) that Apple is running WWDC recaps at their London HQ this Monday [morning](https://developer.apple.com/events/view/3U2W94L6WS/dashboard) and [afternoon](https://developer.apple.com/events/view/Z6PJ6YUTD4/dashboard). Sign up closes at 11:45 today. I requested the afternoon one.
