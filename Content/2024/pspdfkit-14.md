[PSPDFKit 14](https://pspdfkit.com/changelog/ios/#14.0.0) is out! It [supports more operating system versions](https://pspdfkit.com/guides/ios/announcements/version-support/) than we ever have before: iOS 15–18, macOS 12–15 and visionOS 1–2. In recent years, our [annual releases](https://pspdfkit.com/guides/ios/best-practices/version-numbering/) are easy updates that focus on compatibility with the new OS versions.
