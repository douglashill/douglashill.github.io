One of my two Apple Magic Mice started only tracking well on harder/shinier surfaces. [Cleaning the sensor](https://support.apple.com/105045) didn’t help.

[The iFixit forums suggest](https://www.ifixit.com/Answers/View/472985/Fixing+Magic+Mouse+2+which+stopped+working+on+some+normal+surfaces) “a nice 4 foot drop onto concrete”. I tried 1 m drops onto a rug, and bizarrely after about five drops that completely fixed the problem.
