One of my two Apple Magic Mice started only tracking well on harder/shinier surfaces. [Cleaning the sensor](https://support.apple.com/105045) didn’t help.

[The iFixit forums suggest](https://support.apple.com/105045) “a nice 4 foot drop onto concrete”. I tried 1 m drops onto a rug, and bizarrely after about five drops that completely fixed the problem.
