Oh [AirPods Pro Hearing Test and Hearing Aid aren’t available in the UK](https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro/feature-availability/) and I don’t see this option. Unclear how this is actually determined. My physical location and Apple account are UK, while my device region is set to Ireland (which is supported).
