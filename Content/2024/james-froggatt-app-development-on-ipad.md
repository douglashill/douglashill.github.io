Interesting [post from James Froggatt about app development with Swift Playgrounds on iPad](https://mutatingfunc.github.io/blog/2024-10-12-app-development-on-ipad/) (via [iOS Dev Weekly](https://iosdevweekly.com/issues/684?m=web#FVhnFaY)). iPad is my go-to device for almost everything *except* Xcode for now. It seems a shame being limited to code (including third-party code) written in Swift and [JavaScript](/javascript-in-swift/).
