Has anyone used private distribution on Apple’s app store? The [documentation](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/manage-your-apps-availability/set-distribution-methods) says:

> Once your app is approved, the distribution method can't be changed.

It’s unclear if this means the Organization IDs can’t be changed, or just you can’t go between public and private.
