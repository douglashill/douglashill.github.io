Since full ActivityPub support in Threads seems a while off, I thought I’d try [Micro.blog’s cross-posting](https://www.manton.org/2024/10/11/threads-crossposting-from.html). But my newly created Instagram account was immediately banned. I guess I was put on a lifetime blocklist after I [deleted my original account on the day Facebook bought Instagram](/post/2062814590/).
