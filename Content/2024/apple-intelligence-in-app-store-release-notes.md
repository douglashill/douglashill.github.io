[PDF Viewer for Mac](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1120099014) was rejected for this in our release notes:

> Adds Look Up, Translate, and Writing Tools in the menu for selected text. (Writing Tools requires Apple Intelligence.)

App review asked:

> Can you provide instructions on how to verify the Apple Intelligence integration?

Do we need to explain how to select text and show a menu?

Our iOS app with the same features and release notes went through review fine.
