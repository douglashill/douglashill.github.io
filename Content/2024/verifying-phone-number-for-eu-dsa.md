Update on verifying our phone number for the EU’s DSA trader requirements after [Apple’s automatic verification didn’t work with our US Aircall number](/2024/aircall-trader-verification/): I requested manual verification. Apple asked for a business or court document. I attached a PDF of our [website contact page](https://pspdfkit.com/company/contact/). It was accepted.
