Most annoying iPad issue I have right now is a regression from the last couple of months where apps get in a state where some keyboard input doesnâ€™t work. To fix it, you have to tap the fn/globe key. Happens multiple times per day. I guess modifier key state is somehow messed up when switching apps.
