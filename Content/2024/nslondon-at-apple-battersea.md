Iâ€™m extremely excited about our [NSLondon at Apple Battersea](https://www.meetup.com/nslondon/events/303945926/) in two weeks! Weâ€™ll have talks by [Rebecca Owen](https://beccais.online/) and [Oliver Binns](https://www.oliverbinns.co.uk/). RSVPs open at 1pm this Thursday. The organising team, especially [Aled](https://aledsamuel.com/), are putting in a lot to make this happen. ðŸ’œ
