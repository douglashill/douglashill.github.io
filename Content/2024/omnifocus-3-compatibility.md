Release notes for today’s OmniFocus 3 update:

> OmniFocus 3.15.7
> 
> **OS Compatibility** — OmniFocus now presents an informative one-time alert when launched on an unsupported OS.

Uh oh. Sounds like I might need to find an alternative before iOS 18 is out. (Pretty sure it won’t be OmniFocus 4.)
