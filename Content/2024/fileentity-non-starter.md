We‘d been hoping to use iOS 18’s new [`FileEntity`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/fileentity/) to add Shortcuts actions (App Intents) in [PDF Viewer](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1120099014), but any actions using such an entity don’t show up in the Shortcuts app. `appintentsmetadataprocessor` runs successfully. Same in a sample project. Seems to be a non-starter for now.
