After [switching our PSPDFKit documentation to DocC](https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2024/pspdfkit-13-4-ios-multiple-annotation-selection/) we now found the repository can’t be checked out on Windows because DocC puts colons in paths. I just found there’s an [open pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-docc/pull/668) for this.
